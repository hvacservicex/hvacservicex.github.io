<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
