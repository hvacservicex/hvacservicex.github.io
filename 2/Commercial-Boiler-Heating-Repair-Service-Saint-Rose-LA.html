<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are dealt with in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products present a threat just. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for substantial health problems.<p>
