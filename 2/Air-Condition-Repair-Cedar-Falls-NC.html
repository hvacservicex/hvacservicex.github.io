<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
