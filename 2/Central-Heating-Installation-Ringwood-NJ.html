<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

No additional charge.<p>
