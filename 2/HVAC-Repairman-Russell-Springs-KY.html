<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
