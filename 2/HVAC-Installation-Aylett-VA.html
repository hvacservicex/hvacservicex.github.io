<p>Info offered in this safety guide is based upon present scientific and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. Structures constantly progress as a result of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously communicating, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For example, we might see a window as changing slightly in time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be progressing as a result of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
