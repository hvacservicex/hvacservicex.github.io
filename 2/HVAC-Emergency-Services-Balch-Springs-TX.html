<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges used hazardous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
