<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated delay features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
