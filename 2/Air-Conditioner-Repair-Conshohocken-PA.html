<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Conshohocken PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items provide a threat only when they are managed in such a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in.
