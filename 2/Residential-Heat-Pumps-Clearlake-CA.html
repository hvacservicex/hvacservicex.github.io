<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
