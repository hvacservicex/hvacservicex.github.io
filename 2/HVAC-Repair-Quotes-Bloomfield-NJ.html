<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
