<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, reputable, and affordable on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
