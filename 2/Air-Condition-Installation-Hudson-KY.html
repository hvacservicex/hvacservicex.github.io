This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
