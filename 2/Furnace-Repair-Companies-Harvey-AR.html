<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Harvey AR</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
