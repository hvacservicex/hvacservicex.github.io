<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
