<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning experiences in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

It has actually also been shown to trigger cancer in animals and might cause cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
