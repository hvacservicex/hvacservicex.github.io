<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
