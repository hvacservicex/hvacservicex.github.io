Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does provide guidelines about the most common IAQ office complaints.<p>
<p>I had an awful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the assessment on a really cold day they killed the furnace claiming health danger reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new property owner I have actually learned how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
