<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be effectively recognized or treated without an extensive building examination. These investigations may begin with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building detectives examine the history of occupant signs and structure operation treatments. In many cases, these inquiries may rapidly uncover the problem and on-site sees are unneeded.<p>
<p>The main factor property owners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services offered. The cost may not be rewarding if the system is brand-new and still under a producer's guarantee. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the producer's service warranty.
