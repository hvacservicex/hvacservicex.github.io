<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
