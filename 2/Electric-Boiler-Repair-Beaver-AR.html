<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling several spaces at once, but are not extremely energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this might spend more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>

This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
