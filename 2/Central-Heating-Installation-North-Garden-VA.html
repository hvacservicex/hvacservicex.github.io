<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at North Garden VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
