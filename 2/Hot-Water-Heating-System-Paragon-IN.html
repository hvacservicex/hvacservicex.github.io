<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and need to not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the options for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>
