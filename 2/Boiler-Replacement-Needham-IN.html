<p>If your a/c unit is more than eight years old, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's a basic issue like debris blocking the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to evaluate not just the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components may increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>

For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
