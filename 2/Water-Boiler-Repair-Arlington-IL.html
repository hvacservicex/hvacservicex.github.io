<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
