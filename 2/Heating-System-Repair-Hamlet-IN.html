<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Hamlet IN Home</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that things ran smoothly without any sound, I was very happy in the beginning. Moreover, I saw obvious changes in my electrical power bills. After 2 years, things began to change. There have been awkward noises. I got it repaired and checked. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. But then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler typically take place when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is incorrectly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the instructions above under A/c Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
