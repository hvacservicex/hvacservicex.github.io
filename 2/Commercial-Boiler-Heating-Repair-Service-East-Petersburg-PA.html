<p>To be honest, few of the centers managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us because of that. Usually they were at first thinking about from another location keeping track of some other element of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs.

<h3>Install Air Conditioner in East Petersburg PA</h3>
<p>We called Elite HVACS on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out same day to evaluate scenario & chose to choose them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were extremely expert, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
