<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up.
