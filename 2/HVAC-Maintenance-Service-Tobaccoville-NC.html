We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use.
