Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
