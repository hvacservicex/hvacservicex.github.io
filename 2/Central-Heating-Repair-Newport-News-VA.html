Air pressure differences created by these forces move airborne contaminants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
