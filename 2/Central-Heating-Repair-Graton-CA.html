Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, merely including refrigerant is not a service. A qualified technician should repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>For instance, contaminants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting toxins into the environment. Or if the outdoor air consumption lies near a source of moisture or other outside contaminant, it might work as a pathway to bring the impurities inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working as well as it needs to-- if debris is obstructing the outside air intake, for instance, or the filters are polluted or badly kept.<p>

<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. Most ground source heatpump have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
