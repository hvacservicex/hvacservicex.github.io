After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
