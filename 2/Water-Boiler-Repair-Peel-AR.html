<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
