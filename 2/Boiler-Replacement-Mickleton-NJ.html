All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again.
