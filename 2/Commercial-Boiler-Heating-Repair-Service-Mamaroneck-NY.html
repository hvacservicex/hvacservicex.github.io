During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the living space.<p>

It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification.
