<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality issue is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area.
