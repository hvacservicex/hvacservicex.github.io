<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large company in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
