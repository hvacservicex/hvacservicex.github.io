<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the damaging effects of lead. Kids might have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
