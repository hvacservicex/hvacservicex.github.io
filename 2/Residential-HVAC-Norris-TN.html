Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
