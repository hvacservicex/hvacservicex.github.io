<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.
