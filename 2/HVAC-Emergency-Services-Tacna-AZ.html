<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
