For instance, residential HVAC installation should be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced in a different way from duct cleaning.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.
