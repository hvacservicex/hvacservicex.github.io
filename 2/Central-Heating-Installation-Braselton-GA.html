<p>Usually the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
