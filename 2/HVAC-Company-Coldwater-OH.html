<h3>Truth About Coldwater OH Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is typically used in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
