<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your house's duct, affecting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
