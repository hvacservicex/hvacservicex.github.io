The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
