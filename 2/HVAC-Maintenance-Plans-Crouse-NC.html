Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But a lot of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>

<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain poisonous substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores. The main risk of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than the majority of allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>We often install small built-in electric space heating units when we include or redesign on a room. Unlike heat pumps, these units are self-contained. They are likewise safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating systems. They come in many different types: wall-mounted systems that are excellent for little areas like restrooms, cove heaters that resemble baseboard heating systems but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that offer a gentle sunshine-like heat from above.<p>
