<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
