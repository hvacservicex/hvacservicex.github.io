Lots of common building products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is typically recommended instead.<p>
