<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

Ventilation, a typical method of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will decrease but not eliminate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking produces such large amounts of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to considerably decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses significantly. Subsequently, the most efficient method to lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to remove smoking there.<p>
