Many typical structure products utilized before 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.

A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is typically suggested instead.<p>

Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
