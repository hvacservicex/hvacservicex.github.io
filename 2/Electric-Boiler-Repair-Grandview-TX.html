<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
