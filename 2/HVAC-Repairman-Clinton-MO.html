<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
