<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
