<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
