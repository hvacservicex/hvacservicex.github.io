<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
