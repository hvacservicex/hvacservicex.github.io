<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years ago and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
