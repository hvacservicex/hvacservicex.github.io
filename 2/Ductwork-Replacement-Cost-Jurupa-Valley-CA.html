It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>We needed two check outs - Jake came out first and was enjoyable and extremely educated and polite. Grant came out a couple days later on and was great and likewise knowledgeable to speak with. They both did a fantastic job. Sabre's office staff is very useful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are likewise well priced for their services. Definitely suggest.<p>

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
