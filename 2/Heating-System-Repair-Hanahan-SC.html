<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental expenses.

<p>Air contaminants can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your pets to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older homes may consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
