After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
