<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More major than most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major respiratory disease.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats.
