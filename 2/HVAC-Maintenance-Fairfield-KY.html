<h3>Benefits of Expert AC Repair in Fairfield KY</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require reasonably little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is necessary to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water areas). The systems must be inspected a minimum of two times per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
