<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Hardyville KY</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

When we do any repair, the parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts warranty.
