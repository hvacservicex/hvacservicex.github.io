Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on rare events.<p>
