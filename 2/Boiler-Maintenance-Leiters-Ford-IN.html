<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leakages, just adding refrigerant is not a service. A qualified technician should repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
