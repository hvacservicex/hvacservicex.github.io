<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor.

In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
