<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns.

Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and pipes quality.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
