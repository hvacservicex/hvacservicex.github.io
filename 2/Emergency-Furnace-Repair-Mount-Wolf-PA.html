<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>To set up a safe assessment or appointment with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your area in an online search. Message or call professionals to ask whether they can carry out an assessment over the phone or perhaps over a video call. In this manner, they can examine the problem without increasing the threat of virus transmission by visiting your home.<p>
