<p>In addition to getting the huge image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to supply threshold notifies.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
