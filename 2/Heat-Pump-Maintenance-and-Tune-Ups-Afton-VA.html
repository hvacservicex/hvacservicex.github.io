<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
