<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Houses can have the same indoor air issues as single-family homes due to the fact that a number of the pollution sources, such as the interior building products, home furnishings, and family items, are similar.
