<h3>Everything You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair in Willow Spring NC</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
