<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
