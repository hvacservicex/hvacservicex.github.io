<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
