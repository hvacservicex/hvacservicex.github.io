<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Markleville IN</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air conditioning unit. In reality, you can even Do It Yourself, despite our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our suggestion, anticipate to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air conditioning. Furthermore, cooling contractors may charge an additional $50 to $200 for additional materials and devices.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
