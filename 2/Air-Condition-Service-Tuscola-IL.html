While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heater that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
