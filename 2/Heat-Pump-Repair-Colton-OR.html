<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in collecting info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
