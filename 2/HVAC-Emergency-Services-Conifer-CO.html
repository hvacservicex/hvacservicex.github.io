<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and homes matters, especially given that we invest most of our lives indoors. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
