<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that feature owning a high-demand, seasonal business. A thoroughly crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to handle those lulls and peaks so your revenues remain healthy year-round.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.
