<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Woodacre CA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
