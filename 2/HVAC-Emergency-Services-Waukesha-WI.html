<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
