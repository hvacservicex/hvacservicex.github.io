<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services offered.
