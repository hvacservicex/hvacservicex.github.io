The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
