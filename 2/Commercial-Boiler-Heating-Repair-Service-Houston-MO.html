From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
