Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy.
