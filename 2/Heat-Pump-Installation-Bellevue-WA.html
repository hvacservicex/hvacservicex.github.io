<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Bellevue WA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their performance gradually. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
