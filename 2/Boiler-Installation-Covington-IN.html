<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Covington IN</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
