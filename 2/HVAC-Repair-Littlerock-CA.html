<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
