<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from.
