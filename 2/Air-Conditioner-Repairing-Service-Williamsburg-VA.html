<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Williamsburg VA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
