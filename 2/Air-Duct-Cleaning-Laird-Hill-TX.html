<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
