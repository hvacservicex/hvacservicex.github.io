<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
