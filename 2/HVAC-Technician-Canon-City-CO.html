Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
