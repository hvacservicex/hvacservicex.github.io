<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
