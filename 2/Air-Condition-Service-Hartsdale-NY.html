<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might pick to change the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system.

However, considering current modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be smarter to replace the whole system.<p>
