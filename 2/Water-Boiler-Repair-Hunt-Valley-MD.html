Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried.
