<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not restricted to homes. In reality, lots of office complex have significant air contamination sources Some of these buildings might be improperly aerated. For instance, mechanical ventilation systems may not be created or operated to offer appropriate amounts of outside air. Lastly, people typically have less control over the indoor environment in their offices than they do in their homes. As an outcome, there has actually been a boost in the incidence of reported health problems.<p>
