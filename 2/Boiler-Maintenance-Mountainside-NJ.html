<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of reducing exposure to indoor air toxins, likewise will lower but not eliminate direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking produces such big quantities of toxins, mechanical or natural ventilation techniques do not remove them from the air in your house as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to substantially decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. As a result, the most effective way to reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
