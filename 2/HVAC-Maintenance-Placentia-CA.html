<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources might not present a considerable health risk by themselves, a lot of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that most people can take both to reduce the threat from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to act that can lower the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
