<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon ends up being caught in concentrations and structures build up indoors.<p>
