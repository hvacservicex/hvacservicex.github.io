<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested.

The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also without delay followed up with the needed evaluations from the city.

At the very same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
