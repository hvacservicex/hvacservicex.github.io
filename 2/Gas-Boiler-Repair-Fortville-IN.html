<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

<p>We look at clues before we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heater. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>

If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area.
