<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems.

When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
