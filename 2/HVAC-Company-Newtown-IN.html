<p>The function of a lot of building ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at sensible energy expenses. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video alone. Just like determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of system for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
