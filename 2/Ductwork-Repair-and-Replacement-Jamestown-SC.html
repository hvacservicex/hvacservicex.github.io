Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's hard to find an honest AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
