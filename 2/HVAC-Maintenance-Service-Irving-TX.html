<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
