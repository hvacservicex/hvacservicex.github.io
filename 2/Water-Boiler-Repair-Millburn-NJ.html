<p>Correct ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room air conditioners. In addition, they run out the way, quiet, and hassle-free to operate. To conserve energy and cash, you need to try to buy an energy-efficient a/c unit and lower your central air conditioner's energy usage. In a typical air-conditioned house, air conditioning takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy annually, causing power plants to discharge about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate because it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
