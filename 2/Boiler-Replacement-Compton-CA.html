The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>First, know that a majority of your central air conditioning and unit cost will come from the unit itself. AC system costs start at $2,000 and can actually exceed $10,000 for larger homes. As you saw just recently, you require an appropriately-sized unit for your home. Otherwise, the AC will break down earlier than expected or your month-to-month energy expenses will increase. For that reason, you don't have total control regarding your AC system material expenses.<p>
