<h3>Fixing Your Boiler in Bull Shoals AR</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house construction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofings, walls, and floors. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Many aspects impact IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering into the building. Sometimes, specific pollutants like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas with time) may cause bad IAQ.<p>
