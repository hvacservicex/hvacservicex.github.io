<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine components. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires handled by specialists, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
