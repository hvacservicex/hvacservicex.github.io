Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
