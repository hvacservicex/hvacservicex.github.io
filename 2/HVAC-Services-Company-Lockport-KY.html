<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
