Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Just as with switches, someone may have switched off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a handle that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms at the same time, but are not very energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat.

The service technicians who set up the brand-new system were professional and quick, while taking some time to make certain we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
