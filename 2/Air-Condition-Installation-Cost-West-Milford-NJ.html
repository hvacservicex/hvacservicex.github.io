Simply as with switches, someone might have switched off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a deal with that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. You might have a pilot light if you have an old furnace or boiler.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began.
