Make sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
