<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

Not just will obstructed vents and registers impact your comfort, they can also lead to duct leakages due to extreme atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
