<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Parker Ford PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
