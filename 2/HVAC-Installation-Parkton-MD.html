<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
