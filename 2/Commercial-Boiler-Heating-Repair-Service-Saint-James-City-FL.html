Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
