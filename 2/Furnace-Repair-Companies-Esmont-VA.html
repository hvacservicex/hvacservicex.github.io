<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 should be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
