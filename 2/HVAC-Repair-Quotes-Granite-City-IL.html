<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants may collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor pollutant, it may work as a path to bring the pollutants inside.

<p>Radiant heat involves setting up coils or pipelines in the flooring, supplying heat from listed below and moving up. It provides an even, overall heat temperature level throughout the space. Without any moving parts, it's extremely peaceful and comfy, and it does not stimulate as much dust and allergens, as compared to forced-air systems. It also doesn't produce any drafts, and getting rid of the requirement to blow air makes it more energy efficient.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
