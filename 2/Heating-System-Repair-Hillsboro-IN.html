These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can likewise bring in air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
