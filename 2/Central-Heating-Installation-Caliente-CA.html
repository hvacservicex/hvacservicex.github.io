<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Caliente CA</h3>

Taylor took ample time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the required electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
