<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter.

<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards usually amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
