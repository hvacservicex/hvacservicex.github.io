On those days when you just can't appear to warm up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this issue since they heat surfaces and not the air itself.

If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
