<p>Many people ignore the extent of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is normally imagined as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides utilized in the home. To compound the issue, it is estimated that the typical American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside, and majority that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>Some health results might show up quickly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.

<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Assessment Method (GROUP) research studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical organic toxins to be 2 to 5 times greater inside houses than outdoors, despite whether the houses were located in rural or highly commercial locations. Extra TEAM studies suggest that while people are using products consisting of organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to really high contaminant levels, and elevated concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is completed.<p>
