<p>A third method to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house may not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items end up being moldy. To detect smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>

The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
