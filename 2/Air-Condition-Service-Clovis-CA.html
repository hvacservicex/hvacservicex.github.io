<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
