A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure.

The technician who discussed our options did an outstanding task in making certain we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The specialists who installed the new system were fast and professional, while taking some time to make certain we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
