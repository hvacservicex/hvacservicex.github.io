<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square video. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the space.

<p>This evaluation is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our options did an outstanding task in making certain we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The specialists who installed the new system were fast and professional, while taking some time to make certain we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
