<p>To establish a safe assessment or consultation with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing professionals in your area in an online search. Message or call technicians to ask whether they can carry out an assessment over the phone or perhaps over a video call.

Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house may not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty.

<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
