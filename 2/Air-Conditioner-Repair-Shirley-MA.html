<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then change it ON.

<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
