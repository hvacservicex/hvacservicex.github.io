<p>Info provided in this security guide is based upon current clinical and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not need you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Makers typically continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment and very large residences. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
