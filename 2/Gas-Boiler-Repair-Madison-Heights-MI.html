<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants.

Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost.
