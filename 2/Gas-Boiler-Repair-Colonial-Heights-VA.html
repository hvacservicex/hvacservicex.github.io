Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded.

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
