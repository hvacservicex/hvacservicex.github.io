Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded.

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, opportunities are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
