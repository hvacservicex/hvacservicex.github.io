<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
