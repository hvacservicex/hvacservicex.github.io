<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>We needed 2 gos to - Jake came out initially and was enjoyable and really knowledgeable and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later and was nice and also knowledgeable to speak to. They both did a fantastic task. Sabre's workplace staff is really useful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Certainly recommend.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
