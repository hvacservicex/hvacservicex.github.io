<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task.

So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which generally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
