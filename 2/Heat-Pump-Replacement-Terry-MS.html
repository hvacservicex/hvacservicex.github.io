<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
