The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
