<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have remained in presence because the mid-90s, and the idea established much earlier than that, its application in houses is still reasonably new.

<p>To start with, The after hours responding to service representative, John, was professional and very polite. Second Of All, Gracion W is a prompt, knowledgeable technician.

<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Trafalgar IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
