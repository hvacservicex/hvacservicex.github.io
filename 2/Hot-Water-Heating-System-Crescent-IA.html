<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
