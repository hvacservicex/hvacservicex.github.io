A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining properly. A constraint in your drain pipes causes a water leak. There are many different places an obstruction can occur. One of the main locations where obstructions begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
