<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
