One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be efficiently recognized or treated without an extensive building examination. These examinations may start with written questionnaires and telephone assessments in which building investigators evaluate the history of occupant signs and structure operation procedures. Sometimes, these questions might rapidly uncover the problem and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
