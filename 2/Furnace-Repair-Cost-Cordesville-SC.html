<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
