<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Essentially, SEER supplies more data based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter when every three months. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
