<p>Outside impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
