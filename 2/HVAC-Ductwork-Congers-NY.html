Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
