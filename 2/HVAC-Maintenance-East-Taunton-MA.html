<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
