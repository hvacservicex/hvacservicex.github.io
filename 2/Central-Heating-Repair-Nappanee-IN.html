<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace since it's the most common heater in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
