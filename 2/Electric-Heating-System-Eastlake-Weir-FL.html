<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can take place over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do quickly.<p>
