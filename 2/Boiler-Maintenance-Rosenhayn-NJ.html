<p>Indoor air contamination is brought on by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>These guys have been great. At a realtor, I sometimes need contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what deal with a house might cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these men two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ may see undesirable or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak with your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
