One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf office to conduct our workshops and needed some heating. After getting in touch with Stability we were offered a fantastic quote on a radiant flooring system. We remained in a time crunch for upcoming event, and Tyler came right out and had us connected in a couple of days. The systems works terrific and the new office feels extremely comfortable. It was an enjoyment dealing with such an expert company and would extremely advise them to anybody trying to find HVAC.<p>
<p>The primary factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services offered. If the system is new and still under a manufacturer's service warranty, the cost might not be beneficial. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee. However, some makers require routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater seems less like a high-end product and more like a need.
