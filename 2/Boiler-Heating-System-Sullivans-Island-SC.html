<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
