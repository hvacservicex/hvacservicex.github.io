Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
