Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
