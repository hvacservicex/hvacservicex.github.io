Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

Review of this information may determine possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
