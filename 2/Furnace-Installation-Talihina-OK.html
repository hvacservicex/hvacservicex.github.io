<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
