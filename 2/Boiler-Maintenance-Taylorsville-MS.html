<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace includes inspecting the recommended connections as well as temperature level and pressure evaluates. Take time to check these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and safe and secure.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
