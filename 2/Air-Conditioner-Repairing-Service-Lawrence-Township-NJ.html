<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
