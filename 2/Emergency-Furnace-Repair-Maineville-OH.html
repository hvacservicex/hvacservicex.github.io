<p>Immediate impacts may appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant results are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year.
