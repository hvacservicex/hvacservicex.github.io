The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
