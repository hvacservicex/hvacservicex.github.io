<p>All Points Heating offers house cooling, air conditioning unit installation, a/c maintenance that deliver reliable, tested efficiency at high effectiveness. Combustion products from automobile exhaust, furnaces, hot water heater, area heating units, fragrant candle lights, oil lights, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items may lead to eye, nose, and throat inflammation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and queasiness.<p>

Right after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be intensified or intensified.<p>
