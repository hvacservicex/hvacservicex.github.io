<p>A health questionnaire should be established and distributed to all worried workers. Such a tool needs to identify the number of people affected; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the office; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); offer a list of particular health symptoms or health problems; identify all makers run in the workplace; indicate the kind of outdoors air contamination; and determine possible sources of task tension.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
