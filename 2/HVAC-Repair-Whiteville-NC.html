<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to buy it. My spouse stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have actually met in a long period of time.
