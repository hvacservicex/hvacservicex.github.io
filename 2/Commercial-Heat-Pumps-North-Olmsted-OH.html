<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in North Olmsted OH</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline irritant might cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
