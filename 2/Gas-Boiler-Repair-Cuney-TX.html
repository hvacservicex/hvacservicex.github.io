<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
