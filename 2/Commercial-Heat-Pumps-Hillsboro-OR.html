<p>We typically set up little built-in electric area heating units when we add or redesign on a space. Unlike heat pumps, these systems are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating systems. They can be found in various types: wall-mounted systems that are excellent for little areas like restrooms, cove heating systems that are similar to baseboard heating units but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted radiant heat panels that supply a gentle sunshine-like heat from above.<p>
