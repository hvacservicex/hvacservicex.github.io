<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
