<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in Damascus</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are associated with exposure to contaminants from bacteria that can grow in big building ventilation systems. Nevertheless, these illness can also be traced to microorganisms that grow in home heating and cooling humidifiers and systems. Kids, elderly individuals, and people with breathing issues, allergies, and lung diseases are particularly susceptible to disease-causing biological agents in the indoor air.<p>
