<p>. Before choosing the installation place of air conditioning unit, a number of primary factors require to be thought about. Firstly, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units must not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any challenges en route of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to supply adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
