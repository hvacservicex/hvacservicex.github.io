For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
