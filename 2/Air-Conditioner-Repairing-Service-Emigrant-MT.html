<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they ought to be placed. Many frequently they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensing unit appropriately.
