<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Beech Bluff TN?</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the specialists thought they just didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
