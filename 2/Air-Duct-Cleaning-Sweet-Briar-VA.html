<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be using them again.<p>

<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Sweet Briar VA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was impressive. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that add to indoor air contamination. Such aspects consist of making use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide emitted by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Sweet Briar VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>These men have been terrific. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what deal with a house may cost. Just recently I needed to contact these people two times. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely would not want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a brand-new, more effective design can combat unstable energy prices, lowering your heating costs by up to 45%. Advancements in heating innovation have resulted in systems that pollute less, increase convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace usually has an AFUE of about 65%. The lowest performance allowed by law for brand-new gas designs is 78%, and there are many options that achieve 98%, for near total effectiveness.<p>
