<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
