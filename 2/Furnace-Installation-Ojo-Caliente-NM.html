<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Ojo Caliente NM</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems usually accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely effective natural gas furnaces can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>In Ojo Caliente 2019 figures, the Bureau of Labor Stats reported a typical wage of $21.89 per hour for HVAC professionals, or $45,540 each year based on 40-hour weeks.
