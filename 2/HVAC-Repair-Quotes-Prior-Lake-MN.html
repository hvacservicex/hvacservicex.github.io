<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
