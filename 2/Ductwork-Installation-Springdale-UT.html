<p>For whole house installations, it's tough, if almost difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing home, particularly a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or numerous rooms like bathrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are quickly refurbished with electric radiant floor heat.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers.
