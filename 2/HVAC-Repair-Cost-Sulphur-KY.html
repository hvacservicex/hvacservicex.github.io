While toxins typically found in indoor air can trigger lots of harmful effects, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of exposure are necessary to produce particular illness. Individuals also react really differently to exposure to indoor air toxins.

<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

The huge majority of these units are multi-family or mixed-use, where a/c is more of an industry standard, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering company Glumac.<p>

They may spread out throughout the whole office or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
