<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
