Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
