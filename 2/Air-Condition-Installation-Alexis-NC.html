<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a number of distinct benefits over forced air heater. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not have to worry about duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of approximately 30% in other heating system types. Transmitting heat through strong things will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a glowing system will warm up quicker, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the many advantages that a radiant heating system can provide you.<p>
