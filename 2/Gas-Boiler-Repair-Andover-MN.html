<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your a/c devices. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
