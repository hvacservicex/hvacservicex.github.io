The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

They will search for indications of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c?

Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the ac system and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system won't have the ability to cool your home effectively. These are just a few of the aspects that you require to take into account when purchasing a new AC system.
