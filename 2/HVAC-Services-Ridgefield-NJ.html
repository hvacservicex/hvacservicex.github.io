<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season a/c.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
