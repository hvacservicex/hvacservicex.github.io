<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
