<p>Strategy on investing several thousand dollars for the total system if you are thinking about setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you do not have one in your house. The size of the system figures out the labor hours involved to construct the system.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
