<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
