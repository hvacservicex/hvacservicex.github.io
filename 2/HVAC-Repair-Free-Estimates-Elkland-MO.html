<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and last flooring finish. This is normally used in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
