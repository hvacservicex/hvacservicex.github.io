<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly difficult for your lungs to function effectively, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>Clogged seamless gutters can lead to water seeping into the house, leading to mold development, according to the EPA. Yes, mold can grow practically anywhere if the conditions are right, including on top of your home. Direct exposure to high levels of home mold may set off mold allergic reaction symptoms. Next time it rains, examine your gutters. If you see water dripping out of end caps, streaming on the outside, or leaking behind them, it's time to get out the ladder.<p>
