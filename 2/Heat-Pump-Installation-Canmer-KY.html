<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
