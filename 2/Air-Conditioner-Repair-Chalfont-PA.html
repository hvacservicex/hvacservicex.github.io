<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
