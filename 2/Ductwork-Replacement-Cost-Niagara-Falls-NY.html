<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
