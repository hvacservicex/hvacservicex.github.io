Initially, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about utilizing solid wood items. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes damp.<p>
