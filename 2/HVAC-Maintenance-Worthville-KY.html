<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
