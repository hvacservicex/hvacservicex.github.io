<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
