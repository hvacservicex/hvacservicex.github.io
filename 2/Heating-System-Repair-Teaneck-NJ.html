<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that periodically shows up. When you do notice your furnace behaving oddly, it is very essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible. The faster you react to concerns with your furnace, the much easier they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will just make the problem worse, and often more expensive.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can end up being blocked with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down totally. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be performed in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>You could update to the greatest efficiency gear offered and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician ought to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air escapes the system.<p>

Such details can sometimes be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed.
