Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>The properties and structure of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
