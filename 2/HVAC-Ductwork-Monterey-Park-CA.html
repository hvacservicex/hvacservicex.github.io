<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have multiple control panel. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel need to be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
