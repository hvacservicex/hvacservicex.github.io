<p>Seattle furnaces can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the typical temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a vehicle it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years. Your heating system will work hard for you, however like your car, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running efficiently, prevent issues, and keep your guarantee undamaged.<p>
<p>They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements totally by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
