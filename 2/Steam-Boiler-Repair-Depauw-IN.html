<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
