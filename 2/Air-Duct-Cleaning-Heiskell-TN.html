A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated use of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.. a very beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
