<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
