<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Matthews NC</h3>

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
