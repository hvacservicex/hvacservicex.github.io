<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction.

<p>At present, EPA does not advise using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain due to the fact that they just partly eliminate the radon decay products and do not diminish the quantity of radon going into the house. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a dependable means of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies additional details on air-cleaning gadgets to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
