<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
