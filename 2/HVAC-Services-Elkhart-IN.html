<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Elkhart IN Home</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>

<p>Consumer products that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to trigger cancer in animals.

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may discover musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
