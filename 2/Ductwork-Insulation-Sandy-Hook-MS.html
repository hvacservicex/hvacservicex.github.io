<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
