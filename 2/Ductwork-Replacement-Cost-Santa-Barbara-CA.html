<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay products. Because they only partly remove the radon decay items and do not lessen the quantity of radon entering the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA prepares to do extra research study on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a dependable methods of decreasing the health danger from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers additional information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
