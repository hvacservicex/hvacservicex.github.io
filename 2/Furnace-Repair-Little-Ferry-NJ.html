<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
