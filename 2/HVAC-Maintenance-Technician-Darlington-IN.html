<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
