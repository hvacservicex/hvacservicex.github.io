<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
