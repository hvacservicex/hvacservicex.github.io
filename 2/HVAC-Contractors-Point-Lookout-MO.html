<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Point Lookout MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
