<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
