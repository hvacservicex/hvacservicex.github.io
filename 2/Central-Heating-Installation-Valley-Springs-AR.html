<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
