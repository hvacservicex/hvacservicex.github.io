<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it.

However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are prone to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators.

Radiant heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
