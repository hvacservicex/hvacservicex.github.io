<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
