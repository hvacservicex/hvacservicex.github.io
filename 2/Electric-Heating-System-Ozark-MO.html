<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if required, upgrade the structure envelope.

Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>In the middle of the winter, when the air is bone-bitingly cold, the last thing you want is a heating unit that can't finish the job.

<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling.
