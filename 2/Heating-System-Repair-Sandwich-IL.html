<h3>Picking the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at Sandwich IL</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
