<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
