<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if essential, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more efficient option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

Let the system cool off for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
