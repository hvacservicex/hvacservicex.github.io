A/c assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity.

(He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
