<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Graham WA?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
