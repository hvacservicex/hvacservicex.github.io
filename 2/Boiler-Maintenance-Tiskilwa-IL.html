<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
