<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance.

If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
