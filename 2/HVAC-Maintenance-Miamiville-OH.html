Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly recommend this company to my pals.<p>

<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy efficient approaches of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a few feet listed below ground.

Fundamental improvements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can suggest several qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for recommendations.<p>
