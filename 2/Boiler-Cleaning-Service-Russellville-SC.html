<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, however there are many other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, however result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products add to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers.

<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically crucial to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should request that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
