<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Miami FL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save cash over the long term due to the fact that of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source units. The absence of moving parts suggests you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
