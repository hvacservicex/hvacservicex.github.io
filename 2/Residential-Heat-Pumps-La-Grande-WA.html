<h3>Facts That You Might Not Know About a Boiler Heating Method in La Grande WA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
