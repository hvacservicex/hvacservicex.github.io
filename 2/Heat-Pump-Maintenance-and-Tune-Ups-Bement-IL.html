<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and informative, Ballard Gas provided us a better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these considerable but minor adjustments in his bid. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of current warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch.
