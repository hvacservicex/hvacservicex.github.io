<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
