<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild environment, where the temperature does not get expensive or too low. To put it simply, they are perfect for our Seattle environment! They are extremely efficient, vanquishing most other kinds of heater in efficiency.

However, a geothermal installation typically costs 10s of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which normally indicates it fails in regards to return on investment.<p>
