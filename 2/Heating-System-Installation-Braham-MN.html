<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
