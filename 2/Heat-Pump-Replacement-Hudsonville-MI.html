<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
