<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
