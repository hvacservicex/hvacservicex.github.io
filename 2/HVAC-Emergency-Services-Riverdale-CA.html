<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do quickly.<p>

While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
