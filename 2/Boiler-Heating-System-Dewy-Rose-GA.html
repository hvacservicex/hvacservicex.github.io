Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
