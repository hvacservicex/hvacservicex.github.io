<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
