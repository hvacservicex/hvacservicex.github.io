<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode".

When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
