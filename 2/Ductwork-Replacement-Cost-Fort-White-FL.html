<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Fort White FL</h3>

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
