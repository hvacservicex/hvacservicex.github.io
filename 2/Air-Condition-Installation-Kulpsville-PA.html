<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about potential impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
