<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them up until they have been correctly dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
