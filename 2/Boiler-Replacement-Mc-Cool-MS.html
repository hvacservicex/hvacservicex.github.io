<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on.

Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
