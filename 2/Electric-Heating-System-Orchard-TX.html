<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
