<p>If you operate in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime involves lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your house on your hands or clothing. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil extremely close to houses may be infected from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by highways and roads may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to going into the house. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby, alter your clothes prior to you go home and clean these clothes individually. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy locations rather of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your children from eating dirt, and make certain they wash their hands when they come within.<p>

<p>When central air service stops working throughout a heat spell, you might need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to show up, and you'll most likely pay a minimum of several hundred for the repair.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. If  it does not, you've provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can manage, many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens.
