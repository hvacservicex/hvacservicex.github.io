<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Greeleyville SC</h3>
<p>Health center operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to decrease infection risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration. Although temperature levels are frequently in the comfort variety, some professional treatments, such as open heart surgical treatment, need low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, reasonably high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and process applications, the objective might be to not just control temperature, but likewise humidity, air quality, and air movement from area to area.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
