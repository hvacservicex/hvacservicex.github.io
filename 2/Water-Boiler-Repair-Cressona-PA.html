<p>As with many home enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary widely based on the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners must consider heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
