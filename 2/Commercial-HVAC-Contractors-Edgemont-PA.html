<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
