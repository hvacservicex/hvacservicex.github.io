<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Shandon OH</h3>
<p>When service is less chaotic, it can be the best time to conceptualize creative techniques for promoting your HVAC company too. For instance, you may try taking part in home and garden shows, trade shows or other sort of occasion marketing. Or maybe you'll introduce a contest, a free gift or a special funding arrangement to enhance equipment sales. If the experiments pay off, you can formalize them as part of the marketing method you describe in next year's business plan.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and brand-new air filtration innovations are ending up being more typical as available solutions in residential and commercial HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been widespread, as consumers remain mainly oblivious to the impacts of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your house is located, the local region's environment can alter dramatically. A house located in the South would require an AC system with a size capable of cooling your house due to heat Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would require a much larger heating capability as well which will impact expenses. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioner replacement costs by TONS.<p>
