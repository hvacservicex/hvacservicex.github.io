The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, the majority of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
