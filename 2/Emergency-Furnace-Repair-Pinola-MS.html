<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
