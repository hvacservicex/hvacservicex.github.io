<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some time. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
