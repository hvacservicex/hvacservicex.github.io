<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
