<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
