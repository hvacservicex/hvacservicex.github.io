<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company needs to examine measurements of humidity, air and temperature level flow. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to specifications for building usage and tenancy) ought to be carried out. A structure walk-through to look for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings might be handy. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become contaminated with bacteria or fungi and need to be eliminated, also. In some scenarios, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be checked every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Regularly, however, detectives will need to come to the building to conduct personal interviews with residents, to search for possible sources of the issues, and to check the design and operation of the ventilation system and other structure functions.
