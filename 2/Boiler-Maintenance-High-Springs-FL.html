<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that collects throughout summertimes. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heater burners are inspected and cleaned up completely before chillier seasons begin. Always make certain that the furnace is tidied up each year to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working correctly. If your furnace is in a really bad condition, perhaps it is time to start thinking about purchasing a new one.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced ultimately. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heatpump normally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement may be the most cost-effective solution.<p>
