<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Dunstable MA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
