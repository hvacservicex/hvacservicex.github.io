<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products contribute to bad air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (unstable organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpeting and upholstery products can trigger problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Heavy manufacturing markets employ a relatively little percentage of air conditioning technicians and other HVAC workers, but pay some of the industry's highest wages. Electrical power producing companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Car parts manufacturers, aerospace makers and car manufacturers are all within a couple of cents of each other at approximately $31 per hour, or over $64,000 annually. Railways are another high-wage employer, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 each year.<p>
