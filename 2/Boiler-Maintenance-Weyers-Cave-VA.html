<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
