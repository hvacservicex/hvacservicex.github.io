<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Bolingbrook IL?</h3>

Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
