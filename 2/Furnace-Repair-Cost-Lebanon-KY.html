<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
