<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is unclean or clogged up Before attempting to fix any issue, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan".

For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually found the difficulty location in looking over the costs. He dealt with the problem in one day, had changed the expense to what I thought about fair prior to he called back, understood what may have caused the issue and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not happen once again. I have actually considered All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience confirms that.<p>
