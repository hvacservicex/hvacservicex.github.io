<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new building. Forced air systems will require a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heat systems will need water-to-water heatpump. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating & cooling requirements for your house and is important iin ensuring the efficiency and performance of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in loads. Normally, a 3-ton setup needs to suffice for the average house, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all factors which will influence the appropriate size for your specific house.
