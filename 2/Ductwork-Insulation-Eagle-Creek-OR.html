Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a problem where moisture levels are usually higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can often be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the company have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring information may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
