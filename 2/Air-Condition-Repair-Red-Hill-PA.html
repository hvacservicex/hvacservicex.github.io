<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to understand and keep.<p>
