<h3>Furnace Service in Watervliet MI</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually spotted the problem area in examining the costs. He resolved the issue in one day, had actually changed the expense to what I considered fair before he recalled, understood what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience validates that.<p>
