<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately.
