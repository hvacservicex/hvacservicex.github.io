<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2).
