<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably lowers exposure to contaminants throughout cooking. Incorrect change, often suggested by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

Never use a gas stove to heat your house. When the fireplace is in use, always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
