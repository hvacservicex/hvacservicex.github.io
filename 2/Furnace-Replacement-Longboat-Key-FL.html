Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
