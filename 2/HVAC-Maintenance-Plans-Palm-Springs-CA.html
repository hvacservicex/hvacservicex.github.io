<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
