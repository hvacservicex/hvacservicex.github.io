<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Pea Ridge AR</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
