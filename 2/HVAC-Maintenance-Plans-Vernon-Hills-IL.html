The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
