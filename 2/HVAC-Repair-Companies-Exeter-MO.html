<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one element (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Heating is likewise one of the biggest energy customers in your house, so property owners who might be shopping for a new furnace needs to thinking about replacing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to save cash and assist the environment. The average furnace lasts between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a significant financial investment in your house. Invest sensibly by finding out as much as you can about offered options.<p>
