Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>I have actually utilized all the time for 5 plus years now. I have actually signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers 2 services every year.
