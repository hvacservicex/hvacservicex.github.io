<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
