<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company at Haltom City TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
