<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space a/c provides maximum versatility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
