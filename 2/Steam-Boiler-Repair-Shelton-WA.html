<h3>A Synopsis of Central Heating Systems at Shelton WA</h3>
<p>From rewiring old knob-and-tube systems to dealing with furnace and AC setups, the Seattle electricians and plumbing professionals at Seatown have you covered.

As a member of the Bbb with an A+ Ranking, we take our standing seriously in being an organisation our devoted customers can count on.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
