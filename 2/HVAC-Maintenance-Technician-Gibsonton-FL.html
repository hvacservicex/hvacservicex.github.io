<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heat pump compressor and uses it to heat water. This means that this device can also provide complimentary hot water for domestic use in addition to its conventional geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
