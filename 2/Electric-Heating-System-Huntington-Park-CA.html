<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
