<h3>HVAC System in Centerville UT</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
