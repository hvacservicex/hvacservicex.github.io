<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
