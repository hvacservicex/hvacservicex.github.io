<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Leland NC</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
