<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to figure out.<p>
