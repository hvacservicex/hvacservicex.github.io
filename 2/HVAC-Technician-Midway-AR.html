<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Midway AR</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
