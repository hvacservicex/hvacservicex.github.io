<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
