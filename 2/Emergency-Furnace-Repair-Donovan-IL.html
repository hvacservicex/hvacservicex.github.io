<p>Many commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outdoor air introduced into an area per a system of time, and is frequently expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective.

The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
