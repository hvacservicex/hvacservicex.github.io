<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to leave your property so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can lead to a harmful build-up and jeopardize your safety. The technician will assess all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will try to find indications of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>
