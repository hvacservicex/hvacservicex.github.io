<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
