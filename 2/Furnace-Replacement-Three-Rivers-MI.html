<p>I have been using them for many years for my companies, my own homes and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover a truthful AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure."
