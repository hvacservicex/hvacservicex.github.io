<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
