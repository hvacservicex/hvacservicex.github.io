<p>On average, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is wintry, the evaporator coil is probably frozen.

It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the ac system's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Gas furnace repair experts know that a lot of mechanical failure in furnaces is because of faulty preliminary installation or a repair that wasnâ $ t made correctly.

Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
