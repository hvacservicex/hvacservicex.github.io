<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Stokesdale NC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
