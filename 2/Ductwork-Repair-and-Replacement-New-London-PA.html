<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
