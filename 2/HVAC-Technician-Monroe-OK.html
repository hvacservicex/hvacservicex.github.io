<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
