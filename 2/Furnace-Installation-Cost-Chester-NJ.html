<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
