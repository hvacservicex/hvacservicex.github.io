<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to assist us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the necessary electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
