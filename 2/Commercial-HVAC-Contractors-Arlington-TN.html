Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
