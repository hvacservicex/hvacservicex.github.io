<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>

If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
