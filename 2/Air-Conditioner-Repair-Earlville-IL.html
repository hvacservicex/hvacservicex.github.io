The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.
