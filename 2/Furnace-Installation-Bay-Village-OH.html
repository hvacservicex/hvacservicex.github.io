<p>They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements completely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
