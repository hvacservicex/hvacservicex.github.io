<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Auburn NY</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that things ran smoothly without any noise, I was extremely happy in the start. Furthermore, I saw noticeable changes in my electrical energy expenses. After two years, things began to change. There have been uncomfortable noises. I got it fixed and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
