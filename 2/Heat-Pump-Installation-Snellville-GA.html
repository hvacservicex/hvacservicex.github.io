Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
