<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>

<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Petroleum IN?</h3>
<p>Another approach to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
