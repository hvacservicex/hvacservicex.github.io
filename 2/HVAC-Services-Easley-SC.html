<p>Airflow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Air pressure distinctions produced by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a car radiator or typical family air conditioning unit does.
