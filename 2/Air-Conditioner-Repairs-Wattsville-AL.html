<p>Given that the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy expenses, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological problems. In addition, enhancements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase occupant health and efficiency. 21 In the United States, the EPA has enforced tighter constraints throughout the years. There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can indicate your home might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become musty. To discover smells in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are obvious.<p>
<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality issue is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more intricate concerns-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques listed below may be suitable.<p>
