<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
