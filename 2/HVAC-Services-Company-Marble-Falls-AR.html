<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Lots of AC units come with a number of unique functions that can further improve efficiency and efficiency. For instance, homeowners may wish to look for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to look for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to reduce energy expenses much more. Of course, more functions mean greater central air costs.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
