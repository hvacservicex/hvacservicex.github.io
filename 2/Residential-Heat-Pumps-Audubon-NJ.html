<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
