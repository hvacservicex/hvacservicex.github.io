<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.

Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are listed later on in this area.<p>
