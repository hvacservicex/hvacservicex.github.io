<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
