<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>It is especially essential to take as a lot of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or participating in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
