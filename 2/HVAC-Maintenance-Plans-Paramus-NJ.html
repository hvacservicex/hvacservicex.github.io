<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Paramus NJ</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the floor or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
