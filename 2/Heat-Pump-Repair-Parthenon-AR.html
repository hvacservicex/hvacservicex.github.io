<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
