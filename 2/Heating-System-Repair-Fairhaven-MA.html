Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
