<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts decades, because it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
