<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual need to be required almost any maintenance besides regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners must be professionally checked and changed prior to the beginning of every cooling season.

While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak efficiency.<p>

<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems successfully filters particulates.
