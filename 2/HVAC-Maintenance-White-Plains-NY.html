<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that ideal temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which generally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
