<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Approximately 40 percent seldom or never clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
