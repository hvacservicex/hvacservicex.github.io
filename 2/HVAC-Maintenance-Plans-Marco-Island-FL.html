<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company must examine measurements of air, temperature level and humidity flow. In addition, assessment and testing of the ventilation, heating and air conditioning systems (to make certain it is working according to specifications for developing use and tenancy) ought to be performed. A building walk-through to look for smells and look for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings might be helpful. Leaks need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with germs or fungis and need to be removed, also. In some situations, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Reaction Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and sometimes quality) of outside air that must be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
