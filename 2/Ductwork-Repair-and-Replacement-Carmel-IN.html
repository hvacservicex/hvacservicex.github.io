<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, since 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>
