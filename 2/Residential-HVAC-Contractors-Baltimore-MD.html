<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Baltimore</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
