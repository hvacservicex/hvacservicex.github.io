I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again.
