We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heatpump While space a/c offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
