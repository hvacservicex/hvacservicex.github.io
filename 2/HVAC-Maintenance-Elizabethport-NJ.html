After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning.

<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.
