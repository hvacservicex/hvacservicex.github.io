<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
