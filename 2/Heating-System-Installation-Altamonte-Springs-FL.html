<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
