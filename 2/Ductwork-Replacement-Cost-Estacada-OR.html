There are numerous style approaches in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heatpump operate with comparable principles. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.

They weren't low-cost but a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
