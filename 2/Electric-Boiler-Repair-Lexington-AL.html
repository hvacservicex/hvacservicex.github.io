<h3>Home Furnace in Lexington AL</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is sincere, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and ought to be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can prosper in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances are there will be mold growing nearby. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
