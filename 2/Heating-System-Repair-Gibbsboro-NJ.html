<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
