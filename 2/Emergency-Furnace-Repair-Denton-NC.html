<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
