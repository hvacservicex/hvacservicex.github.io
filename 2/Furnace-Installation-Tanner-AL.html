<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
