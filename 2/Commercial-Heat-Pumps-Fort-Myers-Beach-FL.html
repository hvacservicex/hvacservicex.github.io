<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in regards to environmental costs. Because the energy utilized to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground, it secures the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or contaminants.

While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they release far less greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on.
