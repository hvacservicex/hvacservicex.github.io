<p>UW trainees, visitors and employees ought to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out different activities. If the air quality is bad it can impact a person's health, convenience, and productivity.

An essential part of the program is responding to and resolving concerns of structure residents about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
