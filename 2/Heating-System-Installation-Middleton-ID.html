<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
