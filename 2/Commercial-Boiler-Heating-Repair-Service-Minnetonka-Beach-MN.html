<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>There are numerous actions a property owner can take to choose items that will avoid indoor air problems from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here. Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using strong wood products. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
