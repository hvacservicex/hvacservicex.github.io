Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin.

<p>A lot of reputable HVAC specialists will provide complimentary estimates with an in-person service call. Be careful of HVAC contractors who try to provide you a complimentary quote over the phone, as it might not accurately reflect what they will find as soon as they take a look at the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost quote, that quantity will normally be applied toward your balance due, should you choose to hire that contractor.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. You might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Consider possible impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
