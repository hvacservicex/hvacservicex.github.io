<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
