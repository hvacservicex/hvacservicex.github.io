<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
