<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are many other contaminants that can not just unclean up the air, but cause other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
