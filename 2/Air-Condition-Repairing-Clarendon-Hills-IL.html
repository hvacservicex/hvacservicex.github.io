<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Clarendon Hills IL</h3>
<p>While toxin levels from specific sources might not present a significant health threat on their own, a lot of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that most people can take both to minimize the risk from existing sources and to avoid new issues from occurring. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can lower the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
