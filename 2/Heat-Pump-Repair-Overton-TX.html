<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
