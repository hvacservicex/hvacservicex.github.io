<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels.

Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
