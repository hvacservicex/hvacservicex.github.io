<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Platteville CO</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofing systems, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
