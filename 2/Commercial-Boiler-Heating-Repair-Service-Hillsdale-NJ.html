<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
