<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
