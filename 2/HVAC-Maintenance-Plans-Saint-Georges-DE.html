<p>Prior to you head out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be?

When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into account.
