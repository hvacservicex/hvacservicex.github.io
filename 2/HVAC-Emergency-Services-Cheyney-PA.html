<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
