<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Schaefferstown PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
