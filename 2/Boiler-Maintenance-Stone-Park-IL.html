<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Stone Park IL?</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
