<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in big commercial buildings can not be successfully identified or remedied without a detailed structure examination. These investigations might start with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building detectives evaluate the history of resident symptoms and building operation treatments.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which normally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation.
