<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
