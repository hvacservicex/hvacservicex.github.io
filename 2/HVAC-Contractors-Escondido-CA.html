<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales guy comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
