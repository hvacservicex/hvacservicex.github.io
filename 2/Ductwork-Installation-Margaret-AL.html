<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
