<p>I have been using them for years for my services, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC man and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
