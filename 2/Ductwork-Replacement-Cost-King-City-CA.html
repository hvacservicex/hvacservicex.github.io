<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

All of the current furnaces are far more energy-efficient than those set up even twenty years back. So, while it may appear like a short-term larger expense, a new, more energy-efficient home heating unit will more than most likely save you money in the longer-term by decreasing your annual energy costs.<p>
