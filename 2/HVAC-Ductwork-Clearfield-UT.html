<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Clearfield UT</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
