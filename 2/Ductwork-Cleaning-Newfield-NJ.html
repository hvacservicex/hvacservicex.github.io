Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, consisting of individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
