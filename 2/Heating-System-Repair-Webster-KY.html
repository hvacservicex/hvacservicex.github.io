<p>A health questionnaire must be established and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool should determine the number of individuals impacted; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the workplace; show when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); supply a list of particular health symptoms or health problems; recognize all devices run in the work environment; show the type of outside air pollution; and determine possible sources of job stress.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This usually leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>

Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
