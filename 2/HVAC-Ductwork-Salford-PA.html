<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
