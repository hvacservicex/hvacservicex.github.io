<p>The exhaust outlets permit all dangerous gases to leave your property so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can cause a dangerous accumulation and jeopardize your safety.

However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
