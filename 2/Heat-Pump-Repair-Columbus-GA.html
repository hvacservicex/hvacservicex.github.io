<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
