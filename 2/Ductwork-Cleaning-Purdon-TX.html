Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new furnaces can heat the house.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents.
