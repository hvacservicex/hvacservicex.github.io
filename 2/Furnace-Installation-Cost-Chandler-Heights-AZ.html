<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Chandler Heights AZ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
