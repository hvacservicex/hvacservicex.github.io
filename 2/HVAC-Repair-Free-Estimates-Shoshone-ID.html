<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
