<h3>What to Look for When Hiring an Gonzales LA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
