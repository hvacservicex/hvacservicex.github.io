Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts.

As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>The heat pump got appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can draw out heat from different sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a structure, or from the ground. Heatpump transfer heat from outside the structure into the air inside. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, but with improvements in low temperature level operation and lowered loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>
