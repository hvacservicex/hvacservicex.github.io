<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
