<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Princeton Junction NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
