<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
