<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
