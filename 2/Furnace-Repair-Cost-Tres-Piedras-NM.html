<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
