<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, given that the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it takes into consideration not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
