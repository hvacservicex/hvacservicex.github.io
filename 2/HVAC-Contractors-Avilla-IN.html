<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Avilla IN</h3>
<p>Biological contaminants: the biological impurities can consist of germs, viruses, fungi (mold), dust mite allergen, animal dander, insect bio sediment, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach allergen, etc. and might arise from inadequate maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or might be brought into the structure by residents, seepage, or ventilation air.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
