The device cleans up contaminated air and avoids it from infecting different areas of a medical facility; possible future uses with expert installation include houses, services, and assisted living facilities.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become blocked, minimizing air circulation volume, quality, and distribution. They also may become locations for molds and bacteria to grow and be distributed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be effectively kept to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can often be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent ought to request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this data might recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
