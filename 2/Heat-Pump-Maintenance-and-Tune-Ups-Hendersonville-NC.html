<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
