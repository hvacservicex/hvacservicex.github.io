<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of environmentally friendly houses as part of the growing green building motion. Green jobs accounted for 20 percent of all freshly constructed houses in the U.S. last year.

<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time.
