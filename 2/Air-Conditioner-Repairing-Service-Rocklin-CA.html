<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
