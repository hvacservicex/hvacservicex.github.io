<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the professionals thought they just didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
