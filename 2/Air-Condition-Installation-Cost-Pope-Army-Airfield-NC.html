<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns.

Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
