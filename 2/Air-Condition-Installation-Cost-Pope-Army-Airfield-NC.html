Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
