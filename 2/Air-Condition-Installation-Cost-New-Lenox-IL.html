EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in numerous thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year.

Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain.
