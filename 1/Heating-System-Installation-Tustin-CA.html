Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
