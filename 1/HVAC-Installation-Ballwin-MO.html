<p>Heaters are devices whose purpose is to generate heat (i.e. warmth) for the building.

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your home. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the examination on a really cold day they killed the furnace declaring health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have discovered how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
