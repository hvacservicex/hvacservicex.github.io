Because the cost was undoubtedly sensible, I did not bother to get rival's quotes since of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up.
