<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
