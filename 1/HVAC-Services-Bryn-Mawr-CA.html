(He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is typically used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the 2 types.
