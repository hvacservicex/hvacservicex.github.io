<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions.

When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air may also be an issue.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture indoors is connected with a greater prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
