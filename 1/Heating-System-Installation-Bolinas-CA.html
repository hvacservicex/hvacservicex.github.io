Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
