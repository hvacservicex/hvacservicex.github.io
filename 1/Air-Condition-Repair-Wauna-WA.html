HVAC specialists recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>
