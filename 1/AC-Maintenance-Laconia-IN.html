<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
