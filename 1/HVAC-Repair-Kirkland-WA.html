<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
