<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can pay for, many Seattleites need to find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
