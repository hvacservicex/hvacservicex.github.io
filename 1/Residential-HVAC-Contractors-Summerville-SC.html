<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is usually used in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source systems. The absence of moving parts means you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>

<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Summerville SC</h3>

I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
