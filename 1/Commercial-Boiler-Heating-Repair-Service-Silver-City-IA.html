<h3>AC Unit Repair in Silver City IA</h3>
<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
