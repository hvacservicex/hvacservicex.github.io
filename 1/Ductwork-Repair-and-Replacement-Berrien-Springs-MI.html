<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, up until the required for high-efficiency systems forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under several owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to buy what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
