<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
