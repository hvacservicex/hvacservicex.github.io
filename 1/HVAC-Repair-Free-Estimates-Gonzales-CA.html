<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>For instance, problems emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate adequate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or put in such a way that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Improperly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
