<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency.
