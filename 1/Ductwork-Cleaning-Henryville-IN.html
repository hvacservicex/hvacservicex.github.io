<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Henryville IN</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heating unit can be incredibly efficient in terms of cost. If you have access to complimentary or inexpensive firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything at all. Regrettably, wood-burning heating systems require a really essential natural resource: wood! Wood-burning heat systems may not be great for the environment regardless of being carbon neutral due to the fact that of the amount of wood required to correctly heat your whole house.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
