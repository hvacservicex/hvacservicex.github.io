<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants.

<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Signs of illness caused by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
