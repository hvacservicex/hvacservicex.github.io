<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
