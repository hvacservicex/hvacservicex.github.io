Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
