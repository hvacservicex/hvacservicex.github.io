Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
