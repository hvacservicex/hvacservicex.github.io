<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
