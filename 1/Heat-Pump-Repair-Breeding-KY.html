If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
