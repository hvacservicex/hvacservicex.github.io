The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon numerous aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the ideal temperature level. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Just be worried if your home is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must contact a specialist to check and repair the unit.<p>
