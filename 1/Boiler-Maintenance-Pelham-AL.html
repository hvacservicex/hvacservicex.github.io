Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater.

Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
