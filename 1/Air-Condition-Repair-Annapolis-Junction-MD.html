<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Annapolis Junction Maryland</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

However, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
