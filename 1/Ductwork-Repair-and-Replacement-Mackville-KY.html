<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
