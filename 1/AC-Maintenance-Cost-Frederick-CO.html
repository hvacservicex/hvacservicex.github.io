If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's most likely your problem.
