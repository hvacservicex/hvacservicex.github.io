Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually higher than numerous heatpump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the design you purchase.

<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
