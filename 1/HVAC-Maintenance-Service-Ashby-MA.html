<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can worsen problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
