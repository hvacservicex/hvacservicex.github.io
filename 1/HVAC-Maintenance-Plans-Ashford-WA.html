These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
