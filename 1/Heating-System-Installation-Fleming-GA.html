<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins.
