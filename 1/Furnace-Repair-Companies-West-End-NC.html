<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
