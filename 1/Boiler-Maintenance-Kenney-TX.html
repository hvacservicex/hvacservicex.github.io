<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions.
