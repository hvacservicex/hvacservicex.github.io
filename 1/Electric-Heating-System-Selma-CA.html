<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work growth for HVAC service technicians in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all professions. A number of elements add to this, including the replacement and upgrade of older a/c systems to satisfy stricter ecological guidelines.
