<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
