<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
