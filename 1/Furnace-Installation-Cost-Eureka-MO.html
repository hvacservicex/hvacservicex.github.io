<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal business.

<p>Air conditioning system makers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit fails, start by checking any fuses or circuit breakers.

<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC system is frosty, the evaporator coil is most likely frozen.

<p>A specific a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the very same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat is eliminated. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
