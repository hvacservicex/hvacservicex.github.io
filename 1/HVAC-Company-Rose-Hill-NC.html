<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
