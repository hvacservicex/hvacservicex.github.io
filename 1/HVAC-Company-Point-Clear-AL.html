Location the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter.

Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
