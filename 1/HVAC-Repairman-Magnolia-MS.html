<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
