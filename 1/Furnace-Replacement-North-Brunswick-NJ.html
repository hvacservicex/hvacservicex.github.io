<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has been some publicity recommending that houseplants have been shown to lower levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants get rid of considerable quantities of contaminants in offices and homes. Indoor houseplants must not be over-watered because extremely damp soil may promote the development of microorganisms which can affect allergic people.<p>
