While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room.

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
