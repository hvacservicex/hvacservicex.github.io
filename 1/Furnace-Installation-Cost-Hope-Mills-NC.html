<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Hope Mills North Carolina</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Picking the best size air conditioner is an essential part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to help you with. Here's why buying the ideal size air conditioner matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll end up wasting cash and energy. And if it's too little, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
