<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
