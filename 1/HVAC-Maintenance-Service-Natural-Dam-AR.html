<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>I admit I haven't done the math recently, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits.
