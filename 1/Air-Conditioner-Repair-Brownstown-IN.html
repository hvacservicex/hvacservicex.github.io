<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract..
