<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

However, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.

<p>The installation was quickly, professional and extremely well done. The installers were courteous and understood exactly what to do.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
