<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
