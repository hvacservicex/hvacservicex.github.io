<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
