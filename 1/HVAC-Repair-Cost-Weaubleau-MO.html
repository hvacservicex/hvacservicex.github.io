<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers affect your convenience, they can also result in duct leaks due to extreme air pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a good concept. You won't save any extra money and will wind up triggering more issues for your heater.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one element (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the kind of gases and particles) from workplace machines, cleaning items, construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
