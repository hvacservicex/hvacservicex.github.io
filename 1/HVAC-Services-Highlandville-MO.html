<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
