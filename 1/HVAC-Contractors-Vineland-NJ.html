<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.
