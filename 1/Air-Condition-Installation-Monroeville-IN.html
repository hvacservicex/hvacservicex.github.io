<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. Some of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Preservation and Renewable Energy Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
