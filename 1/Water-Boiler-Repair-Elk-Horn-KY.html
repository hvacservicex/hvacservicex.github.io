<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
