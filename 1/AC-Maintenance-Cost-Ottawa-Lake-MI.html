<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy.

<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs completely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra items. The team showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
