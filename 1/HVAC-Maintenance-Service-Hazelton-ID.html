<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Hazelton ID</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
