<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
