<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, particularly considering that we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>For instance, pollutants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption lies near a source of wetness or other outside toxin, it may serve as a pathway to bring the impurities inside.
