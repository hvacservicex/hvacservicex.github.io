The choice to repair or replace depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the devices, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides greater energy efficiency and comes with guarantee protection.<p>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
