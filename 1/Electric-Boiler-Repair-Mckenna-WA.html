<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a referral later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
