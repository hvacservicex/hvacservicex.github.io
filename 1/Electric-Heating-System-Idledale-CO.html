<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>
