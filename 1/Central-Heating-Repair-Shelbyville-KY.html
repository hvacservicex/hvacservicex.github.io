<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
