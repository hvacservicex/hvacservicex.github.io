<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must examine and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more effective service to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
