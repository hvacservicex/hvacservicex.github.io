<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
