<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task.

So, make certain to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which usually includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
