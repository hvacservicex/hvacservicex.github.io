<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
