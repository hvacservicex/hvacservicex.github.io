<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
