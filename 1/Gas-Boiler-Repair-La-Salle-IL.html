<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
