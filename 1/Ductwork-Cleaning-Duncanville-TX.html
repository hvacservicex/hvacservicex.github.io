<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of individuals with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
