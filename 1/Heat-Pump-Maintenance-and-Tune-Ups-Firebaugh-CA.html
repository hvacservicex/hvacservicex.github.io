<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
