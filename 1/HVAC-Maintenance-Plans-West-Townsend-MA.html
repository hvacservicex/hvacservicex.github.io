<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms. Many modern-day hot water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
