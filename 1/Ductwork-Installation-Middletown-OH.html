<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.)

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
