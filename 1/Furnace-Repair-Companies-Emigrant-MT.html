<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option.

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
