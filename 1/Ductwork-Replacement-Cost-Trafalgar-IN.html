Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the start. But then recognized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
