<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task.

So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
