<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Numerous common structure products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread into the air during the elimination process, removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is frequently advised instead.<p>

Install unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>
