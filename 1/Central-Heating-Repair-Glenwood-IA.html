<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed.
