<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>

We'll visit your home for an extensive assessment, including an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to find the best system for your house.
