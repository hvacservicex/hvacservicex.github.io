<h3>AC Technician in Mentone CA</h3>
<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to install, particularly in an older house. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, certain fuels and equipment may need special licenses, and there is limited versatility in case of changed heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the living space.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
