<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Lompoc CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
