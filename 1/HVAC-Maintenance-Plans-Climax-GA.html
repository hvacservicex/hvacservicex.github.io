<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>

A home situated in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A house in the Northern part of the US would require a much larger heating capacity also which will affect expenses.
