<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be taken to reduce pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures must not be undertaken until these issues have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office complex such as medical facilities and high-rise buildings, automobiles such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, submarines and airplanes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
