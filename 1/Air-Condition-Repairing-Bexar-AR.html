<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
