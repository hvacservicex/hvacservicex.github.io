Permeable materials, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold development and must be discarded.

Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
