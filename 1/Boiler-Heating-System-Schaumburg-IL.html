Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
