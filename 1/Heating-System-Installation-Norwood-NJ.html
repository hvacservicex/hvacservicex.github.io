<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
