They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

Prior to that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
