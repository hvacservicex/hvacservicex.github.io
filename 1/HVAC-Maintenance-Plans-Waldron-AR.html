<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Waldron AR Home Owners</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
