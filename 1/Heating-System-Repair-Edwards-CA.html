<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
