When you have a ten-year parts limited guarantee as is basic on Carrier Â® furnaces, you'll wish to make sure you keep that protection legitimate for the full 10 years.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
