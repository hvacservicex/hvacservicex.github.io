As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
