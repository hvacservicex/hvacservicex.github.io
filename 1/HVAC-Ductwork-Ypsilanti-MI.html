He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
