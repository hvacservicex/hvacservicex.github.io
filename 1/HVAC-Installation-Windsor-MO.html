This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than room a/c unit. In addition, they run out the method, quiet, and practical to operate.
