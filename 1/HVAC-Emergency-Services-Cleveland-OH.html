<p>The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the type of gases and particles) from office machines, cleaning products, building and construction activities, carpets and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside pollutants. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
