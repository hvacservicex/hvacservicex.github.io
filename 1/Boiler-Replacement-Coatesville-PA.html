<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
