<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
