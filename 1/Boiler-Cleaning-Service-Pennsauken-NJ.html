These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
