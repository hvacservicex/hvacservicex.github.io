<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is really critical to maintaining a correct temperature.<p>
