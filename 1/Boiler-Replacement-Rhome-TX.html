<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Rhome TX?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Rhome TX</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of signs in numerous countless asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year.
