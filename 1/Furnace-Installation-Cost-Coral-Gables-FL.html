<h3>HVAC Installation in Coral Gables Florida</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source.

Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
