<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is frequently important to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information may identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring information may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
