<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards generally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with standard devices. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new building and construction (houses normally utilize between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>
