<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
