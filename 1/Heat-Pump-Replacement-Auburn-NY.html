<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate impacts are normally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized.

<p>Lastly, if you do recognize a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and choose to install it in your house, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be substantial. According to figures collected by Angie's List, homeowners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.)

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems.

High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
