<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention.
