<p>Info provided in this security guide is based on existing scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your house's systems. The "life expectancy" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to 20 years. Producers normally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electricity or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
