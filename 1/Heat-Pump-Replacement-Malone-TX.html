One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist existing, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by functioning as a very efficient thermal barrier.
