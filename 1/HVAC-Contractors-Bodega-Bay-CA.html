<p>A SEER ranking stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same period. Essentially, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>
