<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
