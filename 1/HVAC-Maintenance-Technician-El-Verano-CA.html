Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
