<h3>Heating Installation in San Tan Valley Arizona</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the entire system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
