Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better right decision on how frequently your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll need to clean them.
