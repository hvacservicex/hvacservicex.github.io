<h3>The Way to Choose An Expert HVAC Technician in Chino CA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last job is to evaluate the system to make certain it cools effectively. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This last check might point out faults in the thermostat, which might be as simple as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to switch on may just include a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any issues or problems and makes recommendations about upgrades where appropriate.<p>

<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
