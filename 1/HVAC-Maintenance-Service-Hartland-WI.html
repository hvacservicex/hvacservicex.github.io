<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Hartland WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>In basic, repair and improvement activities in owner occupied real estate units are exempt to particular guidelines connected to the management of lead. House owners and contractors participated in repair or remodeling activities need to follow the EPA guide for correct lead management throughout repair and remodeling activities that might result in disruption to paint and other products containing lead.<p>
