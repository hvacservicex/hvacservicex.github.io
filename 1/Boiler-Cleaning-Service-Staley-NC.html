<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
