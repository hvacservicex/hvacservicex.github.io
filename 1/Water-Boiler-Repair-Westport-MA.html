<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that ideal temperature all year round.

So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which normally includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
