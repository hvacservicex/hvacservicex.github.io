<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Service in Morris</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations develop indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
