If you do take our recommendation, expect to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to set up central air conditioning. In addition, cooling contractors might charge an extra $50 to $200 for extra supplies and devices.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as traditional air-source units. The lack of moving parts suggests you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
