<p>A homeowner can effectively learn to do a project such as bleeding and rebooting an oil furnace, but you must be positive that you know what you're doing.

<p>Typically the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
