<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Dowagiac MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
