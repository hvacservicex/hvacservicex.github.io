<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
