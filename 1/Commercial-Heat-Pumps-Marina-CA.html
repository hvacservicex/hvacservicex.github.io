<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
