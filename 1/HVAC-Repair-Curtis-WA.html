<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
