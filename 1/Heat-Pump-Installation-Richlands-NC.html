<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Hiring Richlands NC HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home building and construction is to minimize air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air assists and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
