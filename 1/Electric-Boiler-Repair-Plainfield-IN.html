It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>

They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
