Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S).

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about prospective impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's directions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating system correctly adjusted.

While an area heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
