<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are starting to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers). To learn more about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
