<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Air conditioning is something that most Seattleites will just utilize moderately, however since heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place.

Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the result of repetitive usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to fractures and holes. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
