<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
