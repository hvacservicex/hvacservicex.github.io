<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
