<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
