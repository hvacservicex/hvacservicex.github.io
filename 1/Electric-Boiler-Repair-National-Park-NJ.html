<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it becomes damp.<p>

The air quality within and around structures and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>Both the active and inert components in pesticides can be natural compounds; for that reason, both could add to the levels of airborne organics inside homes. Both kinds of active ingredients can trigger the results talked about in this document under "Household Products," nevertheless, as with other household items, there is inadequate understanding at present about what pesticide concentrations are necessary to produce these impacts.<p>
