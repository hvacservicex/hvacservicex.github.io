<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Shawnee KS</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Given that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was initially driven by increasing energy expenses, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological problems. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also assist increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually enforced tighter limitations for many years. There are a number of methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
