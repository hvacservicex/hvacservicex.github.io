<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Essentially, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company ought to check measurements of temperature level, humidity and air flow. In addition, assessment and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to specs for constructing use and tenancy) should be carried out. A building walk-through to look for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or pest droppings may be valuable. Leaks need to be removed. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being infected with fungis or bacteria and need to be gotten rid of, also. In some scenarios, particular screening for radon or for asbestos may be needed as part of building tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
