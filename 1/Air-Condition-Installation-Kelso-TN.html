<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heater, you may search for a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit.
