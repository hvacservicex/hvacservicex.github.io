<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several aspects consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends on private sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By contrast, changing a furnace and examining filter can normally be done in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
