I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense.

He helped me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again.
