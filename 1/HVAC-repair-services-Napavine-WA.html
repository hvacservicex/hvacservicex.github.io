<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>

<h3>HVAC System in Napavine WA</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air going but also changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke with from starting to end were extremely professional, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
