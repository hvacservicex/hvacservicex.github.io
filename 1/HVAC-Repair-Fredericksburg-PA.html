<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends on several aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which varies greatly from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after duplicated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
