All the wet hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the space that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining pipes correctly. A constraint in your drain pipes causes a water leakage. There are various places an obstruction can happen. Among the main locations where blockages start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
