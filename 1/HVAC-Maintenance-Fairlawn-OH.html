<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for many years.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized different methods. The CMHC research study contacted numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time spent or methods used. The EPA research study recommended and controlled techniques used on a smaller variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have flaws, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have changed because these studies were performed, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
