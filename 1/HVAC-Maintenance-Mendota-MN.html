<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
