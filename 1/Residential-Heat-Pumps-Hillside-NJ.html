They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
