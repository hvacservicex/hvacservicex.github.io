<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
