<h3>The Way to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Saginaw AL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
