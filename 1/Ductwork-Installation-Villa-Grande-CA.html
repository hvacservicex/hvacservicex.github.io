The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, the majority of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
