<h3>Maximizing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System in Willingboro NJ</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is stopped up or dirty Before attempting to fix any issue, require time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Get in touch with a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
