<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance.

No extra charge.<p>
