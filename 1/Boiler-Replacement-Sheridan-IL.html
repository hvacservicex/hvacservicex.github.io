<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Sheridan IL</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
