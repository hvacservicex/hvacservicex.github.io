<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
