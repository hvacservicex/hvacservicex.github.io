<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Because it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild effects that are frequently mistaken for the flu. These signs consist of headaches, dizziness, fatigue, queasiness and disorientation. The impacts of CO exposure can vary considerably from individual to person depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
