<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>

After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement.
