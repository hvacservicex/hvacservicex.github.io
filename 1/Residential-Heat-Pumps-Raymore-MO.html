<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them.
