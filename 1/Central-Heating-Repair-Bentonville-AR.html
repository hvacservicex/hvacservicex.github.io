<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
