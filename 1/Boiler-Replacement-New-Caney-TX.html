<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
