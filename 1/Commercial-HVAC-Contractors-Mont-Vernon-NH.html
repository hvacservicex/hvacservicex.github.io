<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, especially if you reside in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and replaced routinely, your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you expect it to. The heating & cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Checking and altering the air filters is among the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
