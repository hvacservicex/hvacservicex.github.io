If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided guarantee will not do you any great ought to the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and employ a certified individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
