<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>A geothermal desuperheater is useful and extremely efficient, especially during the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's home. Since the excess heat soaked up from within the house is carried out into the hot water tank rather than being transmitted back into the earth, this is.

Furthermore, throughout winter, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water alongside its primary function of offering space heating. This suggests that cost savings are still realized throughout the cooler period. In fact, a desuperheater lowers winter water heating expenses by around 50 percent.<p>
