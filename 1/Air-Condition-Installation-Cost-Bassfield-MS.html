<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very useful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
