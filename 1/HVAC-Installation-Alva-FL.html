Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are necessary in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it via software.
