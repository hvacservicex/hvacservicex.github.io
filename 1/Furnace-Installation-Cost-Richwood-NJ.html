<p>Think about possible results of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the maker's instructions, especially guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
