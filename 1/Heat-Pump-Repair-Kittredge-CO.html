The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Allergen and mold like moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% assists keep them and other allergens under control.
