<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
