<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
