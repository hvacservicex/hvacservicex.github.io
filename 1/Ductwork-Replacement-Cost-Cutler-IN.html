<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
