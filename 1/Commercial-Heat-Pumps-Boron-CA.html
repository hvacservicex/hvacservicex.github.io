<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
