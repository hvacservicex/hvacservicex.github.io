There have actually been uncomfortable sounds. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. Overall, it has been a good experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. But then understood Air conditionings are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to secure your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified agent from a service or merchant to do the installation.
