<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. Another element of the job is recommending customers as to how to avoid future problems and correctly preserve equipment by, for example, regularly oiling parts or changing filters. Simply put, the HVAC technician has 3 goals: Prevent issues. Conserve money. Stay comfy. These technicians may also be associated with working together with sales and engineering departments to develop products that react to consumer needs and market opportunities.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological pollutant. Biological contaminants in the house might consist of mold, bacteria, viruses, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols launched into the air can be dispersed throughout the house by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger infectious diseases such as Legionnaires' illness. They also can trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Symptoms caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, eye irritation, coughing, lightheadedness, and breathing infections.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
