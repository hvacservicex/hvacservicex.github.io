<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already commonly used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
