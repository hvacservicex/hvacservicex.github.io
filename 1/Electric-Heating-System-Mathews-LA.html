<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
