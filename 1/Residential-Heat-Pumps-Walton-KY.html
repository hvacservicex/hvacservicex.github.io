Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
