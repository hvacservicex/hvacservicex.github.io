<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
