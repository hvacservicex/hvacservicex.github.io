Bacteria, bacteria, and viruses likewise can live in the air you breathe every day. These air-borne toxins can affect your home convenience devices, too.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
