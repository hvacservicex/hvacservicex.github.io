<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we recommend utilizing our insulation boards. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below.
