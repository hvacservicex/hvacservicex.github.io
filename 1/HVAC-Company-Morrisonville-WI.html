<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
