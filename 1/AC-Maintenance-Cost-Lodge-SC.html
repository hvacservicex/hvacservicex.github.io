It is also their responsibility to notify employees of the instant dangers that are present.Specific state and local policies might use.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
