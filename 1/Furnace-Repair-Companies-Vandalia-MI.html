<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean considerable cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to change or update your system if it's five years old or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while providing the exact same quantity of cooling.<p>
