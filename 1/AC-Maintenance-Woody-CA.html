<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is calculated utilizing the very same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summer season temperature level to get to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the right SEER score for your location, subtract 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score has to be at least 13 for all new air conditioning systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health results pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not always true that the results noted happen at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed results might take place.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
