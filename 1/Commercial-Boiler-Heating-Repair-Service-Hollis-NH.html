<h3>The Way to Select a Specialist HVAC Technician in Hollis NH</h3>
<p>You depend on your a/c unit to cool you cool when temps outside start to warm up. But in order to keep a comfortable indoor environment, you need every component of your a/c system to be working its best. So if your system needs a new compressor, turn to our group for help. At Around the Clock A/c & Heating, Inc., we offer reputable a/c compressor installation services for residential and commercial consumers in Rye Brook, NY.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
