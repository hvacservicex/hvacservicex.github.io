<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
