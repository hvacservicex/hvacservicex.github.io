<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Buffalo MO</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool down the house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
