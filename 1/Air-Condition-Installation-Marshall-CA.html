<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
