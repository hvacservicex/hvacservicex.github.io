<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
