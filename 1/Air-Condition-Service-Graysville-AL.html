<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
