<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied great customer care at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, many Seattleites should find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service.
