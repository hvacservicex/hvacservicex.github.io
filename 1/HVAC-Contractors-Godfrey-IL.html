<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to change 2 heating systems in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as constructing materials, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch pollutants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies release contaminants periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented home appliances or improperly utilized products can launch greater and sometimes dangerous levels of pollutants indoors.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request.
