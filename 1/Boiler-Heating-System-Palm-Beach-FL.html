<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Principles Handbook includes heating and cooling calculations. The design expert needs to speak with ASHRAE information for the standards of style and care as the normal building codes supply little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, nevertheless. Other useful recommendation products include items from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>There is a required balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE scores frequently come with greater price tags.

For the majority of temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having a very high ranked heating system is not always needed.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating in Palm Beach FL</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
