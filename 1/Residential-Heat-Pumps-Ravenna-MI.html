<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. Because they just partially get rid of the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon going into the home, the efficiency of these devices is unsure. EPA plans to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a reliable methods of minimizing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point.

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years prior to that.<p>
