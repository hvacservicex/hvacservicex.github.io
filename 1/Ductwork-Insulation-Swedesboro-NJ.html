<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
