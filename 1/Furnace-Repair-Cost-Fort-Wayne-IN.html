<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
