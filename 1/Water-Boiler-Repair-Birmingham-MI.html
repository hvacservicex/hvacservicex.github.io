<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
