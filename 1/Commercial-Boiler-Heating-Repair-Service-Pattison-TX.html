<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
