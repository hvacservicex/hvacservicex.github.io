<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention.
