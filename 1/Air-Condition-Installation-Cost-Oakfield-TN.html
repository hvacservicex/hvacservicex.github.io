<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
