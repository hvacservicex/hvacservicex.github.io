<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate adequate amounts of outside air.

Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological impurities that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>
