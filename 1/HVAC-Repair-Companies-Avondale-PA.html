<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
