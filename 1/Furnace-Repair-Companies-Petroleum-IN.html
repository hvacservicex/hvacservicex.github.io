<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
