<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>There is an essential balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE rankings typically include higher price tags. So, make certain to decide based on how typically you will use your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For most temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high ranked heating unit is not constantly needed.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
