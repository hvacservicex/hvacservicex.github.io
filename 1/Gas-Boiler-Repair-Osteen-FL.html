The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside system.

However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the overall power is not simple, because it considers not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
