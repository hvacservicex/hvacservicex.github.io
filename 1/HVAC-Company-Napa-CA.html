<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
