<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
