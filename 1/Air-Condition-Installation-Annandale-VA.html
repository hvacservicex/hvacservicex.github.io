<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Services in Annandale</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses electrical power, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
