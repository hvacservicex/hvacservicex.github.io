<p>Resideo uses a range of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System solutions for both new building and retrofit applications. Breathing air toxins can lead to asthmatic and allergic reactions, infections and other illness that involve the lungs, nose and throat. For example, family pet felines, caged birds and rodents, and pets can produce dander and other particles that can set off allergies or asthma symptoms in some people. Pre-owned smoke is likewise damaging to people, particularly children.<p>
<p>For instance, pollutants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outdoor air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor toxin, it might serve as a path to bring the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working as well as it must-- if debris is obstructing the outdoor air consumption, for instance, or the filters are polluted or improperly maintained.<p>
