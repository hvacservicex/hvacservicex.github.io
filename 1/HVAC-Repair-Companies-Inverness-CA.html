<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
