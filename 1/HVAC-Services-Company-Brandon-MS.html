<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
