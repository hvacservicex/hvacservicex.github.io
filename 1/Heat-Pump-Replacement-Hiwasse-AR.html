This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
