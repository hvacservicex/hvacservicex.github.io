<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
