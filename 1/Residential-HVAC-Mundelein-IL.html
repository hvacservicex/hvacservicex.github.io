<p>Consider a whole home dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and making it possible for greater comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
