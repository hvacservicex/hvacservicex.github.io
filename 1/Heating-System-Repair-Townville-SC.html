<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.
