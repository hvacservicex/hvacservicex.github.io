<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
