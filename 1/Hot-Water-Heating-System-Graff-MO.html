<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children might have greater exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
