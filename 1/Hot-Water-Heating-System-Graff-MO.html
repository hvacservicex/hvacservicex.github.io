<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead.
