<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
