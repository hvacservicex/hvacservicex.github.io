<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly minimizes direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Inappropriate change, typically indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue.

Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
