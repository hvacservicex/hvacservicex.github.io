<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones.

Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
