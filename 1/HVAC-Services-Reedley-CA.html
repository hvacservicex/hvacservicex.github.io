<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
