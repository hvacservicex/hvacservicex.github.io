A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person ought to be required nearly any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioners need to be professionally checked and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual examination. While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>
