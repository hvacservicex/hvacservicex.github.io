Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
