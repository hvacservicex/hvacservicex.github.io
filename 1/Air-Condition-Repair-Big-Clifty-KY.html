The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

At the same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run due to the fact that of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
