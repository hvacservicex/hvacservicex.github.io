<p>The properties and composition of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground. These need to be taken into consideration before picking the best style of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes needs less pipes to attain the desired underground heating & cooling effect, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will need more pipelines.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one element (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
