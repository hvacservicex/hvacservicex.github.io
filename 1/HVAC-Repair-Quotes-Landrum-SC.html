<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
