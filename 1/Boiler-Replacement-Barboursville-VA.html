If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>

<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological impurities are damp or wet building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.
