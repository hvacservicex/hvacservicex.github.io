Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
