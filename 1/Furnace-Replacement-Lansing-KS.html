<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
