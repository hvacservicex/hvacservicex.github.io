<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
