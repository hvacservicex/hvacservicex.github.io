<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
