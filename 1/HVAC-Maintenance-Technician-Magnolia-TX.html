<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
