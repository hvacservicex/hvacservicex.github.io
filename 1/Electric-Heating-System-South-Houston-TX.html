<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
