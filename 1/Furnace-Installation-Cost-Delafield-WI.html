<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for great building management.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, check out Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
