<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, merely adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician ought to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and performance of your air conditioning unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
