<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
