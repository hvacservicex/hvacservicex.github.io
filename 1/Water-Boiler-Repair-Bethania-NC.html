<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
