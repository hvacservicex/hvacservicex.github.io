Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
