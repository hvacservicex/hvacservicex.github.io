<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be placed.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are usually near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
