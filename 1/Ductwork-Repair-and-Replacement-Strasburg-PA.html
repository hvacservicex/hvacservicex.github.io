<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot.
