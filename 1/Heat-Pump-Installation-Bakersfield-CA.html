<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
