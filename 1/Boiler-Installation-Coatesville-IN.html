<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
