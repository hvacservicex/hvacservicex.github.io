Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can infect a building's a/c system.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal.
