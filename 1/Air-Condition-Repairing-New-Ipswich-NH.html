<p>Central air systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had found the problem area in examining the costs.
