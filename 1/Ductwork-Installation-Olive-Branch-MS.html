<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
