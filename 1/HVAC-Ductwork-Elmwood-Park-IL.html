These various heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
