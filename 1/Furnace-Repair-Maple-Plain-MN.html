<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room.
