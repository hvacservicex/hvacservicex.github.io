What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them till they have actually been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
