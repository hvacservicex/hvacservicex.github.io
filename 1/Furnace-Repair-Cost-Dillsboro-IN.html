This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually.

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is typically vital to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
