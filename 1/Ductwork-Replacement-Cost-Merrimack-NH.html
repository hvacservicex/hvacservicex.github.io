<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
