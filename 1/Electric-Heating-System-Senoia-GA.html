<h3>HVAC Repair in Senoia Georgia</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
