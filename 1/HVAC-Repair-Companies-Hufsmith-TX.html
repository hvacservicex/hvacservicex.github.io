American Standard a/c are one of the very best central air conditioning brand names in the business. The typical cost to install a 14 SEER American Standard AC unit would be around $2,600 to $3,200.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months.

Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
