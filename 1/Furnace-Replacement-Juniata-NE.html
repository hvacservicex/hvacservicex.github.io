<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the lack of sufficient ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the main issue in over half the office indoor air investigations it has carried out.

These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is essential in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
