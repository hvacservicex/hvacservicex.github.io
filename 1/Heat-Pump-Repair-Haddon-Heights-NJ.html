<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Through typical usage and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system might become extremely dirty.

This is an exceptional opportunity to determine parts that are worn or faulty. Replacing them to fix the cooling might be a lot more economical when the issue is reasonably small.<p>
