<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
