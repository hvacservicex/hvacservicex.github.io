<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Lulu FL HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
