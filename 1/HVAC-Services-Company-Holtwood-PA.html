<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
