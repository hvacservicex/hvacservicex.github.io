A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
