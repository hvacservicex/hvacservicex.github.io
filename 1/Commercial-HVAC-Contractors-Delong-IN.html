Because it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
