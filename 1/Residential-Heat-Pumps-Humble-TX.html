<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
