<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps generally require excavation to set up, which includes numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>

By being familiar with more about an HVAC company prior to you call, you'll understand whether they are the very best company to handle the service or issue you need them for.<p>
