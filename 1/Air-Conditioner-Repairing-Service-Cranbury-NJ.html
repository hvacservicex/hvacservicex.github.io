<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in over half the office indoor air examinations it has carried out.

These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is important in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>When you purchase a brand-new heating and cooling system, you're investing in your house, your family, and your company.
