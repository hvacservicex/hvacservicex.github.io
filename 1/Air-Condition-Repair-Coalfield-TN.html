<p>UW staff members, visitors and students ought to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform various activities. If the air quality is poor it can impact an individual's health, convenience, and efficiency.  The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to provide and preserve comfortable and healthy environments free of contaminants. An essential part of the program is reacting to and fixing issues of structure occupants about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Frequently, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be efficiently recognized or remedied without a detailed structure examination. These examinations may start with composed questionnaires and telephone consultations in which structure investigators assess the history of occupant signs and building operation treatments. In some cases, these questions may rapidly uncover the issue and on-site check outs are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
