<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual.

<p>There is no simple response, but numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better service.
