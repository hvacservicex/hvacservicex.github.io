<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
