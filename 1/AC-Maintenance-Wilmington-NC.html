<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used various methodologies. The CMHC research study gotten in touch with a number of duct-cleaning services.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
