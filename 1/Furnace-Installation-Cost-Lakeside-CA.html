<p>Oil heating systems are generally not very effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain a performance higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation as well because a drain requires to be installed.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
