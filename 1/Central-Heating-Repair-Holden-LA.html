<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Holden LA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
