<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Greenfield MO</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
