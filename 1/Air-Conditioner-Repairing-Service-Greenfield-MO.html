<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the first time.

<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Greenfield MO</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Furnaces are the most popular heating systems in the country. They provide a strong heat output, are fairly simple to repair and install, and deal enough various varieties to be practical in practically any climate you can think of.
