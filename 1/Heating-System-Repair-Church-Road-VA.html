<p>Even more recent furnaces less than five years old have actually been discovered as bad. Too many property owners are shocked to discover that their 'new' furnace  heat exchanger. In many cases it is due to poor furnace style, but in many cases, it's from overlook. Apotheosis Heating & Home Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Evaluation of your furnace consists of a System Analysis, which checks for debris on the burners, bad airflow, and a dirty filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as required.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
