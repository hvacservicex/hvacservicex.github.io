<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the assessment on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace declaring health threat factor and contractor laws for their decision.
