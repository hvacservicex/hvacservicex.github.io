<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than numerous heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you acquire. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating choices. This suggests it can heat up your house to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
