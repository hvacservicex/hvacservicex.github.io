<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Heating is also among the most significant energy customers in your house, so homeowners who might be shopping for a new furnace needs to considering replacing it with a newer, more energy-efficient design to save money and assist the environment.

<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
