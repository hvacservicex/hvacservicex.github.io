Improperly located outside air consumption vents can likewise bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reputable than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar energy relies on routine sunlight to work efficiently.

This makes geothermal heating a dependable and available source of energy.<p>
