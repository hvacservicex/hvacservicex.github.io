<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better service. If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality.
