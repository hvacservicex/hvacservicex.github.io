<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Illness (BRI) refers to less frequent (but often more serious) cases of individuals becoming ill after being in a particular building at a specific time. In these cases, there is usually a comparable set of medical signs experienced by the individuals and a clear cause can often be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Disease is an example of BRI caused by germs which can pollute a building's cooling system.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Usually, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there might be germs accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat away from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c's evaporator coil.<p>

Actions that will minimize benzene exposure consist of eliminating smoking within the house, providing for maximum ventilation throughout painting, and discarding paint materials and special fuels that will not be utilized immediately.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
