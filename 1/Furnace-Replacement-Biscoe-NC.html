<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Biscoe NC</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
