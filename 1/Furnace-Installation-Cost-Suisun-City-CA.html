<p>EHSI's indoor air quality team masters integrating a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you select for your house.

<p>More common in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
