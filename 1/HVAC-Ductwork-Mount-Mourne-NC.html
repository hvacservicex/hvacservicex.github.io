<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that ideal temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service strategy which usually consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these designs include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
