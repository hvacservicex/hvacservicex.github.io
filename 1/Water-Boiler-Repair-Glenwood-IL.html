<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

By dealing with a professional company, you can identify the problems in your house and find permanent treatments that create a safe space for your household.

<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
