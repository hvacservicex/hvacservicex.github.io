<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a contemporary furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate considerable cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a build or remodelling job. For instance, Warmup's StickyMat solution can be set up as a Do It Yourself task as it is basic to set with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily connected to the mesh, ready to be rolled out in location. Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
