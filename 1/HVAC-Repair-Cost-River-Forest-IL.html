<h3>Choosing the Ideal HVAC System For Your Job in River Forest IL</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is unclean or clogged Prior to trying to repair any issue, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Examine the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it if the air filter is good to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
