<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

<h3>Steam Boiler Repair in Moody MO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
