<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other specialists concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure materials, cigarette smoking, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in made products. For example, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
