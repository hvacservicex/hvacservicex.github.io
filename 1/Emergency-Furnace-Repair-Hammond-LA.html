<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand.

<p>Allergens are materials that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
