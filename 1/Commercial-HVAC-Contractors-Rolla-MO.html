<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
