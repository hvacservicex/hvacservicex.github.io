<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
