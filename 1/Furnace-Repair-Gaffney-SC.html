(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.)

For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into account.
