It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
