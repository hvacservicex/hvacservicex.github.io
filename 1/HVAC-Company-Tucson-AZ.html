<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
