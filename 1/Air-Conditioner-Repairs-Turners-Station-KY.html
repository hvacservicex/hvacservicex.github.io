<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response information which show the health impacts of repeated direct exposure to one particular chemical. Comparable data is not offered for long-term, low-level exposures to a combination of pollutants as is the case for IAQ problems. Currently, there is not enough information available to forecast the impacts of exposure to several potentially damaging agents at the exact same time.<p>
