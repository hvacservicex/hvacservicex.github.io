<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as a really effective thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece below.
