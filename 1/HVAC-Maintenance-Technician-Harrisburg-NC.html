<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and hence requires conditions ideal for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella break outs in commercial structures differ, but often include very warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts.

<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air path. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
