<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of outside or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>

<p>Certain immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically hard to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution.

If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some impacts might be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
