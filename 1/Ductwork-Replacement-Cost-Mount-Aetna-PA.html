<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
