<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Albion IN</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside may trigger residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat distribution over the whole surface of a floor warms the lower half of the room, enveloping inhabitants in heat at a lower overall temperature level-- in many cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater." In other words, in-floor heating unit provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfy we feel, the more likely we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or musty smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>
