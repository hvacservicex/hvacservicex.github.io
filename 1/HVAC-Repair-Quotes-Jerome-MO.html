<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>

Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
