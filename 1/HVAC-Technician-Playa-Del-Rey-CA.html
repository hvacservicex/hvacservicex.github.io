<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
