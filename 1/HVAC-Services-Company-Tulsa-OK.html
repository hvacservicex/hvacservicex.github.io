<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A/c unit manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality products. Start by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
