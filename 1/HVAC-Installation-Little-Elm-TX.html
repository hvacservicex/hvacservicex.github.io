<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
