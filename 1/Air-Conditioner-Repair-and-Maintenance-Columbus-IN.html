<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage.

While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
