<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow constraint will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
