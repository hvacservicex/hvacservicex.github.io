<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
