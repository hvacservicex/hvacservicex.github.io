<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Tucker GA?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<h3>Furnace Service in Tucker GA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
