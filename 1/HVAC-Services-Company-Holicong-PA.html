<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
