<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>For toxins other than radon, measurements are most suitable when there are either health symptoms or indications of bad ventilation and particular sources or pollutants have been determined as possible reasons for indoor air quality problems. Testing for many contaminants can be costly. Prior to monitoring your home for contaminants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or experts who have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial buildings.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
