Everyone we talked to from starting to end were very professional, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
