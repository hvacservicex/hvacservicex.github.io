<h3>Determining Heat Vacuum Cleaners in Gepp AR</h3>
<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to order it. My wife stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have met in a long period of time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
