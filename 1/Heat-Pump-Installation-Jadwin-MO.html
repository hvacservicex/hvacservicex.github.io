<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Regardless of the type of electric radiant floor heater, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any interference or disturbance in the flow of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is among the downsides to installing an electric convected heat system. However, presuming they are set up correctly and effectively looked after, the likelihood of them having issues is little.<p>
