<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the possibilities are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is dirty, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be working at optimum performance and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not huge enough for your home. It will have to work harder and may get too hot if the system is too small. Generally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
