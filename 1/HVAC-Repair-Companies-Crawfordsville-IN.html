<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
