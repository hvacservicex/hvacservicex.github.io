CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>

This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
