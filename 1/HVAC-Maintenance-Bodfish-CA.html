<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
