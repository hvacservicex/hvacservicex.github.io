In jobs where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>

You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to figure out.<p>
