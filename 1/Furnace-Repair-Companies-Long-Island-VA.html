(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
