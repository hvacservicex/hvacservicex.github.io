<p>The residential or commercial properties and structure of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These should be considered prior to picking the very best style of an underground cooling and heating system. Soil with positive heat transfer properties needs less pipelines to accomplish the desired underground heating and cooling result, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater airflow from the outside, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and new air filtration innovations are becoming more typical as offered options in residential and commercial HVAC product bundles.

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
