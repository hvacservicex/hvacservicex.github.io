<h3>AC Technician in Glendora California</h3>
<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
