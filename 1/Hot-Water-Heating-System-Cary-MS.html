<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins.
