Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
