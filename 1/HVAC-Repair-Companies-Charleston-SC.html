<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
