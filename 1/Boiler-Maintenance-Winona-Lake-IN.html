<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>For instance, problems emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in adequate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Improperly situated outdoor air consumption vents can likewise generate air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.
