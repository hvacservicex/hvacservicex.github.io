<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Trinity</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the conventional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
