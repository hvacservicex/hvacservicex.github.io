<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
