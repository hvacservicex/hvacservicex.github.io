<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Picking the Right Solebury PA Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c unit and heatpump must be without all obstructions and debris.

Excess moisture can cause problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the residential or commercial property, uneven temperature regulation, germs, and compromised air quality. A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to ensure all excess wetness streams far from the system.<p>
