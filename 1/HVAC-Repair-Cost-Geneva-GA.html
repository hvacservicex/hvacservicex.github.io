If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website.
