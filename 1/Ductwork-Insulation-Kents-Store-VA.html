<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we dealt with problems.
