<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a few years back.<p>
<p>You might upgrade to the greatest effectiveness gear offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The typical house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air leaves the system.<p>

<p>Heat from a hydronic heating unit can make a house comfy even at lower temperatures. You can turn the thermostat lower and conserve even more cash on energy because of this. If you run your hydronic heater on a high-efficiency boiler at low temperature level, you can increase its life-span. This conserves you much more cash in the long run. Our service technicians can further encourage you on how to save as much energy as possible with a hydronic heating unit.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
