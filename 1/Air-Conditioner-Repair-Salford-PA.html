My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170.

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one action specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
