The majority of frequently they are mounted at height-level or somewhat lower, if individuals mainly stay seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some compounds makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're trying to track you'll require to place the sensing unit accordingly.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
