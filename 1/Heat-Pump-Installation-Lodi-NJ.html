<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

Lastly found somebody to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
