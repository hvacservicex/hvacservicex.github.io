If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on often might be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.
