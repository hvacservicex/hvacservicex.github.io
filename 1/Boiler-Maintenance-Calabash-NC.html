<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are typically just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.
