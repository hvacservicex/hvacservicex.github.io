Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
