<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
