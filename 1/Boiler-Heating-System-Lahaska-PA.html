For instance, house owners might want to look for one that comes with an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
