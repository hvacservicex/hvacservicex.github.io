<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Dumfries VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that ideal temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
