Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
