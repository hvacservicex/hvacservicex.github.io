<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Playa Vista CA</h3>
<p>Provider's Healthy Structures Program provides a broadened suite of innovative services to assist deliver much healthier, more secure, more effective and efficient indoor environments throughout key verticals including commercial workplaces, health care, hospitality, retail, and education. From products to enhance indoor air quality and remote services to manage ventilation in buildings to touchless options in public areas, Carrier is redefining the areas of the future, today.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
