<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
