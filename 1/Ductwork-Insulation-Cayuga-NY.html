<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not easy, because it takes into account not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
