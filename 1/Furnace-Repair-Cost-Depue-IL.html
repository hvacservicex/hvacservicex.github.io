This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
