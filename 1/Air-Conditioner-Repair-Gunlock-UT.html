<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be required to minimize contamination from sources inside the house.

In addition, homeowners ought to look out to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures ought to not be carried out up until these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues before we offer recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting money by not changing the older unit.<p>
