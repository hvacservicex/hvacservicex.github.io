According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company.

That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps guys working. When a sales man comes to your home he exists to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and ought to not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
