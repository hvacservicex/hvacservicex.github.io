<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
