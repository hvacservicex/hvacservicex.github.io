<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely happy that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the specialists believed they simply didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
