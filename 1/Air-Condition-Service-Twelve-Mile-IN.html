This is usually utilized in a third-floor or second location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put.

<p>Buy education and training: HVAC is not "rule of thumb" work, and no two homes are the exact same. When technicians are effectively trained, they pick and set up effective, safe equipment.
