<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
