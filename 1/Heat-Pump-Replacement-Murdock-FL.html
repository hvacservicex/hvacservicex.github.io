<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
