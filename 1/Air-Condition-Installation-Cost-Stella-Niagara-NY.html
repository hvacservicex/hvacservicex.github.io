<p>Since they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
