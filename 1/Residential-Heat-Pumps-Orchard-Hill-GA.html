It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
