<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
