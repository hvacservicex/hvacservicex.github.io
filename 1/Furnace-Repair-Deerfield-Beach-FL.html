<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
