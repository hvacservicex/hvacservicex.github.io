<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My wife said that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have satisfied in a very long time.
