<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
