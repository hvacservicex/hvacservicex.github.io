Talk to your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no client grievances have been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid. Compare the different furnace performance scores advised by the specific contractors to pick the design and system that finest fits your energy requires. Keep in mind that energy-star ranked equipment will save you money in the end but might include a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
