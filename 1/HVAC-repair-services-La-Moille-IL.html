<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
