<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Taylor Michigan</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
