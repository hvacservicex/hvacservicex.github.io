<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really handy in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
