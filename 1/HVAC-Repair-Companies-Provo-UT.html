<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Employ a professional each year prior to winter season hits to ensure your heating and cooling components are running optimally.
