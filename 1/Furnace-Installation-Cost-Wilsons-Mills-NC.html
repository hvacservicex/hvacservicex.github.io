<p>Expert heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC experts advise following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance gos to each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other perks. Some companies provide priority consultations to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
