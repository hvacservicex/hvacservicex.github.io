<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. Another element of the job is advising clients as to how to avoid future issues and properly keep devices by, for example, frequently oiling parts or changing filters. In other words, the HVAC technician has 3 objectives: Prevent issues. Save cash. Stay comfortable.

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
