<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
