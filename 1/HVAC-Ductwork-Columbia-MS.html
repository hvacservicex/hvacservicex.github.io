<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building and construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove products of incomplete combustion.
