<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have breathing issues, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be lurking in your environments.<p>
