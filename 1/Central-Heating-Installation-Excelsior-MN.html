<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Excelsior MN</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
