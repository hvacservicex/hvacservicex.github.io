<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new construction (houses generally use between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.
