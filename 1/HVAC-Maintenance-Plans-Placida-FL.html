<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
