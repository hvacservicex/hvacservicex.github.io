<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
