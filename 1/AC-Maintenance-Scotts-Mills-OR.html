<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
