Stale air may likewise be an issue when ventilation is not sufficient to represent a boost in the variety of workers in the area.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE scores frequently come with greater price tags. So, make sure to choose based on how often you will utilize your heating system, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.
