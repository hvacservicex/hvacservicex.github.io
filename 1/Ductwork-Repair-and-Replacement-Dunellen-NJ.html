This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built.

When radon ends up being trapped in structures and concentrations build up inside, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
