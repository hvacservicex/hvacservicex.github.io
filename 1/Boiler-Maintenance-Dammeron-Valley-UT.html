<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly seem greater than normal, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is even more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel expenses immediately, not to discuss the cash you'll save on repair expenses. If your heating unit is 25 years old or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness benefit because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
