<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Rollinsville CO</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might trigger attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been revealed to cause cancer in animals and might cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
