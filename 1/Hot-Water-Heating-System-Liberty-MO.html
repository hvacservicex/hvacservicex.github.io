All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
