<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's vital that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the quantity of heat you want produced. If the system is too small, then your house won't be heated up adequately and the system will have to continuously go to try to heat the whole home, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outside air that need to be continuously supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation combined with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
