Insufficient ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly located outside air consumption vents can also generate air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.
