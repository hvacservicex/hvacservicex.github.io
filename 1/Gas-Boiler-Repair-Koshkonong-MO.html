<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices typically lasts years, given that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
<p>The primary factor homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services used.

Nevertheless, some producers require regular maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
