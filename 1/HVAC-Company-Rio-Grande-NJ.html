Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are important in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>

Radiant heat systems tend to be far more energy effective than other heating systems, for something. Required air heating unit tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output.

Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
