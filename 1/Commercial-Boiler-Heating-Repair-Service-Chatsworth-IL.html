Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

If your home is not heating up, just be concerned. However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to call in a professional to check and repair the system.<p>
