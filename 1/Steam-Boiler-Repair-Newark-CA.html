<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
