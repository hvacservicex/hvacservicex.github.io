<p>Similar to the majority of house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heater can vary extensively based upon the size of the house. A lot of furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, homeowner need to consider heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
