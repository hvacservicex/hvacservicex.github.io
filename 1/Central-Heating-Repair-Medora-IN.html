The companies were not made aware they belonged to a study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or approaches used. The EPA study prescribed and controlled approaches used on a smaller variety of houses. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have flaws, no other research has challenged the findings.

<p>A geothermal desuperheater is useful and extremely effective, specifically throughout the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's house.

Additionally, during winter, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water alongside its primary function of providing area heating. This implies that cost savings are still understood throughout the chillier duration. In reality, a desuperheater decreases winter season water heating expenses by approximately 50 percent.<p>
