<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of unusual being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
