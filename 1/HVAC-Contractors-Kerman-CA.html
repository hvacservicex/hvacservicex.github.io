<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
