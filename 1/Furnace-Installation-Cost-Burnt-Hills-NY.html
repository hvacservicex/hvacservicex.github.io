<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>For example, issues arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or placed in such a method that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants.
