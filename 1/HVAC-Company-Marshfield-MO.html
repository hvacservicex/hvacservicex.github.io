<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be living in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
