<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name.

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
