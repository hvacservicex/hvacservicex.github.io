<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other types of ac system, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to press the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and keep.<p>
