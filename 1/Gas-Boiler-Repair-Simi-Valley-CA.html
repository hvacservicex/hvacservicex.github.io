<h3>Heater Repair in Simi Valley CA</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine situation & chose to go with them for the work. I enjoy to state that not only did we get the central air going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from beginning to end were very professional, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>. Prior to selecting the installation place of ac system, several main factors need to be considered. First off, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the location of rest or workspace.
