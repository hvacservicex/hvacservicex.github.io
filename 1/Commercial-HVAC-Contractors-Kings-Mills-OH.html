<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, simple and a completely enjoyable individual to have around that whole time. His time and competence to SOLVE the concern cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a rather unsure diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Kings Mills Ohio</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>There's a huge difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical kind of house heating-- convection.

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the ceilings, floorings and walls heated. In turn, the objects in the space, like furnishings and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
