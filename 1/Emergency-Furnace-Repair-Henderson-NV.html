<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
