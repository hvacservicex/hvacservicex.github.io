<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
