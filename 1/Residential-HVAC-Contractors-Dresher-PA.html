<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if required, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>
<p>For example, issues occur when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure residents.

Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
