<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various approaches. The CMHC research study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they were part of a study, and the researchers did not manage for time spent or techniques used. The EPA research study prescribed and controlled approaches used on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both research studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed given that these research studies were performed, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were fantastic! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements completely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra items.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
