<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply suggestions to change instead of repair a heating unit. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
