<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are utilized to seeing this type in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal components also. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms at the same time, however are not very energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this might invest more money on cooling costs in the long run since of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
