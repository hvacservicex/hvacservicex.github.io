<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw.
