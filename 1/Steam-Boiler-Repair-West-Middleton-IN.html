Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking cigarettes, family products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
