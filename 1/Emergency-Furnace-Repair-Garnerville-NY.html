The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The easiest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
