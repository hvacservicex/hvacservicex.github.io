Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
