<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Want to Know in Haworth NJ</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items.

<p>When an organisation compartmentalizes like this, it can even more increase efficiency, cut unneeded expenses, and increase revenues.
