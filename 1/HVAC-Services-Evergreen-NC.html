Pressed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).
