<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
