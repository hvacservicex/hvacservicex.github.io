The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these devices doubts because they just partly remove the radon decay items and do not diminish the quantity of radon going into the house.

<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as health centers and high-rise buildings, vehicles such as cars and trucks, trains, submarines, ships and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your physician about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
