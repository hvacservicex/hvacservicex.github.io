<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
