<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control panel. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and manage of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
<p>Replacing your old furnace with a new, more effective model can fight unstable energy rates, reducing your heating costs by up to 45%.
