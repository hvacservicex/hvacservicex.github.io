<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house.
