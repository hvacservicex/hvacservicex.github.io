<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Seven Mile OH</h3>
<p>Most people know that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air pollution can likewise have significant, hazardous effect. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the top five ecological health risks to the public.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
