Many heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners must consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house.

<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Westport CA</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes much more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are frequently set up in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters occasionally and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their performance gradually. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
