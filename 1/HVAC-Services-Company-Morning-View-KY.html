<h3>AC Maintenance in Morning View Kentucky</h3>

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Morning View KY</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the ac system before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
