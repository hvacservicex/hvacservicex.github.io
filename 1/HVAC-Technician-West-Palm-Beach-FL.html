If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
