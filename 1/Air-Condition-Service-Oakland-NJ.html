<h2>How To Hire HVAC Company in Oakland</h2>

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>House owners might also assume that because a radiant flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home enhancement, its installation will right away raise their home's value. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or negatively affects property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Maybe Real estate agents should consider a lot of variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system might add to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate. That stated, homebuyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
