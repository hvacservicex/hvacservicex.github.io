Furnaces that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how often I ought to change my air conditioning filters, there are many things to take into consideration.
