<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>They have not traditionally used remote or virtual services because HVAC technicians require to be physically present to do their work. Nevertheless, with the significance of social distancing due to COVID-19, the requirement for remote abilities is greater than ever.

Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, below.<p>
